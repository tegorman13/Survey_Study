<!-- Johansson, K. (2016). Understanding recycling behavior: A study of motivational factors behind waste recycling. Waste Management and The Environment VIII, 1, 401–414. https://doi.org/10.2495/WM160361 -->
<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Globally, waste volumes are increasing rapidly and the World Bank estimates a 70% global increase in municipal solid waste up to 2025. Waste may have serious environmental consequences and there is a strong correlation between solid waste generation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. These two observations alone indicate that this development is not sustainable. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the environmental impact of waste. While, waste recycling in OECD countries is reported to be approximately 22% on average, many developing countries have recycling rates in the range of 1–3%. A key aspect in succeeding with any recycling effort is how authorities and other actors relate to both informal and formal waste workers. This paper reports on the findings of a systematic literature study with the aim of exploring waste recycling behavior, with a special focus on motivational factors, both physical and psychological, behind recycling. Three levels of descending importance for recycling have been identified, where two are vital for success, and the third is desirable; 1) a well-designed infrastructure for recycling 2) specific recycling knowledge, and, 3) a general understanding of environmental aspects. Any attempt to implement or improve recycling systems and/or recycling behavior, needs to consider these aspects and the insights gained through this research may provide decision makers with practical assistance. The paper also contributes by providing academia with a framework for further studies on the behavioral aspects of recycling.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Johansson (2016) proposes a model that highlights the interplay between individuals’ willingness to recycle and the external conditions that facilitate or hinder recycling efforts. The model underscores the importance of both psychological factors and systemic infrastructure in shaping recycling behaviors. <em>Committed recyclers</em> exhibit both high motivation and access to simple recycling systems. Their actions are often driven by internal motivators such as environmental values, altruism, or guilt, as well as external pressures like social norms or incentives. This group actively incorporates recycling into their daily routines, making it an intentional and consistent practice. In contrast, <em>uncommitted recyclers</em> demonstrate low motivation but still engage in recycling due to the ease of the process. For this group, the presence of highly accessible and straightforward systems, such as curbside collection, ensures participation even in the absence of strong environmental beliefs. Their behavior is largely habitual and reliant on external simplicity rather than internal conviction. <em>Involuntary non-recyclers</em> are individuals who are motivated to recycle but face significant external barriers, such as limited access to facilities, inadequate infrastructure, or unclear instructions. These barriers hinder their ability to act on their environmental intentions, suggesting that targeted interventions to reduce these obstacles could activate their latent motivation to recycle. Finally, <em>uncommitted non-recyclers</em> neither possess a strong belief in the importance of recycling nor have access to simple systems that encourage participation. This group is the least likely to engage in recycling, as they lack both internal motivators and external facilitators. Efforts to influence this group are most effective when systems are designed to make recycling as effortless as possible. Johansson’s (2016) model highlights the critical role of simplicity in recycling behavior, often outweighing the influence of motivation. While motivation can drive proactive efforts to seek out recycling opportunities, simplicity ensures broad participation by reducing the cognitive and physical barriers to action. These insights are invaluable for designing effective recycling programs, particularly in diverse populations where motivational levels and systemic support may vary.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Purpose – A considerable amount of research suggests that the way information is processed may influence a purchasing decision; however, this seems to be an issue rarely investigated in green marketing studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to draw on the literature related to the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to provide a deeper insight into the factors affecting pro-environmental behavior intention. Design/methodology/approach – The framework highlights the moderator role of environmental motivation and environmental knowledge in the relationships among message framing and pro-environmental behavior intention. The study used an internet survey to help reduce the social desirability bias associated with a face-to-face survey. In total, 497 questionnaires were collected, of which 68 were invalid and 429 were valid. Findings – The results indicate that it might be beneficial for green marketing proprietors to provide product-related information stressing the potential negative consequences of not buying organic food products. This effect, however, is moderated by the degree of the customer’s environmental motivation and environmental knowledge. Originality/value – This stands in marked contrast to the traditional information which emphasizes the positive consequences to motivate customers to purchase organic food products.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Chang and Wu (2015) examined how environmental motivation and knowledge influence the effectiveness of message framing in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Their study highlights the nuanced roles of these variables, revealing that motivation and knowledge interact to shape individuals’ processing of environmental messages and their subsequent behavioral intentions. For individuals with <em>high motivation and high environmental knowledge</em>, message framing (positive or negative) had minimal impact on pro-environmental behavior intentions. This group relies on heuristic processing due to their confidence and familiarity with environmental issues. Their established knowledge allows them to engage with environmental behaviors consistently, regardless of framing. In contrast, those with <em>high motivation but low environmental knowledge</em> exhibited significant sensitivity to message framing. This group engaged in systematic processing, carefully evaluating the information presented. Negatively framed messages, which emphasize the adverse consequences of failing to act (e.g., environmental degradation), were particularly persuasive. The negativity bias, characterized by heightened attention to potential losses, drove stronger pro-environmental intentions in these individuals. For individuals with <em>low motivation</em>, environmental knowledge played a limited role in shaping behavior. Regardless of whether their knowledge was high or low, this group processed messages heuristically and exhibited minimal differences in response to positive or negative framing. Their lack of motivation hindered deeper engagement with the content. Overall, Chang and Wu (2015) suggest that message framing should be tailored to the target audience’s level of motivation and knowledge. Negative framing is particularly effective for motivating high-motivation, low-knowledge individuals, while for other groups, framing may have a lesser impact. These findings underscore the importance of understanding cognitive and emotional factors in designing effective environmental communication strategies.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ The household spending of Pakistani consumers on sustainable food consumption has continued to remain low. Hence, the present study used the goal-framing theory to explore the consumer’s motivational factors that derive sustainable consumption of organic food. Drawing on survey data of 488 respondents, the findings show that gain and hedonic motivations significantly affect purchase intentions; however, normative has an indirect role. In addition, the knowledge and perceived price significantly moderate the motivational factors. The study provides invaluable insights for policymakers and practitioners in identifying the motivational factors, and the means of guiding the right behaviors for sustainable consumption.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Khan et al.&nbsp;(2022) investigated the role of gain motivations and environmental knowledge in shaping consumer intentions to adopt sustainable behaviors, particularly the consumption of organic food. Their findings, grounded in goal-framing theory, emphasize the interplay between personal incentives and cognitive awareness in driving sustainable consumption. <em>Gain motivations</em>, such as financial savings or personal benefits, were shown to have a direct positive impact on pro-environmental intentions. These motivations influence consumers by appealing to their self-interest, fostering sustainable behaviors when aligned with tangible benefits. <em>Environmental knowledge</em> emerged as a significant moderator in the relationship between gain motivations and behavioral intentions. Consumers with higher knowledge levels were more likely to perceive the value of organic food, amplifying the effectiveness of gain motivations. Knowledge also serves to bridge the gap for less environmentally conscious individuals, helping them recognize the benefits of sustainable practices. The study highlights the need for strategies that combine educational efforts with incentive structures. By increasing consumer awareness and aligning sustainability with personal benefits, policymakers and marketers can encourage broader adoption of environmentally friendly products. Additionally, addressing barriers such as price perceptions is crucial, as higher costs can undermine the influence of gain motivations and knowledge. This work underscores the importance of integrating motivational and cognitive factors into sustainability campaigns, suggesting that tailored approaches can maximize the effectiveness of interventions across diverse consumer segments.</p>
<!-- Alawadh, A., Rafi, N., Kalyar, M. N., & Abrudan, D. B. (2024). The role of motivation and knowledge in promoting green consumer behavior in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development, 8(13), 9152. https://doi.org/10.24294/jipd9152 -->
<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ This research explores the factors influencing consumers’ intentions and behaviors toward purchasing green products in two culturally and economically distinct countries, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Drawing on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study examines the roles of altruistic and egoistic motivations, alongside environmental knowledge, in shaping green consumer behavior. Altruistic motivation, driven by concern for societal well-being and environmental sustainability, is found to have a stronger impact on green purchase intention and behavior in both countries, particularly in Pakistan. Egoistic motivation, which focuses on personal benefits like health and cost savings, also contributes but with a lesser influence. The research employs a cross-sectional survey design, collecting data from 1000 respondents (500 from each country) using a stratified random sampling technique. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relationships between variables and test the moderating effects of environmental knowledge. The results reveal that environmental knowledge significantly moderates the effect of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green purchase intention, enhancing the likelihood of eco-friendly consumption. These findings underscore the importance of environmental education in promoting sustainable consumer behavior. The originality of this study lies in its comparative analysis of green consumerism in two distinct contexts and its exploration of motivational factors through the TPB framework. Practical implications suggest that policymakers and marketers can develop strategies that appeal to both altruistic and egoistic drivers while enhancing consumer knowledge of environmental issues. The study contributes to the literature by expanding TPB to include the moderating role of environmental knowledge in understanding green consumption behavior across diverse cultures.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ The research by Alawadh et al.&nbsp;(2024) provides significant insights into the roles of motivation and environmental knowledge in promoting green consumer behavior, specifically examining two culturally distinct contexts: Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Using Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework, the study evaluates how altruistic and egoistic motivations interact with environmental knowledge to shape sustainable behaviors. The findings highlight that <em>altruistic motivation</em>—rooted in concern for collective well-being and societal ethics—plays a more dominant role in fostering green purchase intentions and behaviors than egoistic motivation in both countries. In particular, Pakistan demonstrates a stronger reliance on altruistic motives, reflecting cultural values that emphasize collective welfare. In contrast, <em>egoistic motivation</em>, tied to self-interest such as health benefits and cost savings, has a smaller but significant effect on green purchase intentions, particularly in Saudi Arabia. A critical contribution of the study is its exploration of <em>environmental knowledge</em> as a moderator. It reveals that higher levels of environmental awareness enhance the impact of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green consumer behavior by improving individuals’ understanding of the benefits of eco-friendly products, reinforcing moral reasoning, and increasing perceived control over their actions. This moderation effect is more pronounced for altruistic motivation than egoistic motivation, emphasizing the importance of environmental education in driving sustainable practices. Moreover, the study notes contextual differences in motivational dynamics, with altruistic drivers aligning with societal ideals in Pakistan and egoistic factors, such as health benefits, resonating more in Saudi Arabia. These findings underline the importance of tailoring green marketing and policymaking to reflect regional cultural values and socio-economic conditions. Alawadh et al.&nbsp;(2024) advance the literature by extending the TPB framework to include the moderating role of environmental knowledge and by comparing green consumer motivations across diverse cultural landscapes. Their work suggests that a combination of motivation-focused and knowledge-enhancement strategies could effectively bridge the gap between green purchase intentions and actual behaviors. These insights have practical implications for designing culturally sensitive interventions aimed at fostering sustainable consumer habits.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ The motivations and barriers of the actual green purchase behavior are as real as the product itself, which makes it a systematic process to examine the inconsistency between consumers’ motivations and their actual behavior (motivation-behavior gap). The study aimed to clarify the direct and indirect effects of motivations on the purchase behavior of green food. The proposed conceptual model was adopted from the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework and was extended by adding the serial mediation of consumer perceived knowledge and trust as major constructs. Data were collected from 1788 consumers in China. Results provided support for the model and showed that perceived knowledge about the food supply chain could be both barrier and a positive factor of consumers’ purchase behavior, which mainly depends on the trade-off between certification and planting knowledge. Differences in trust exist and consumers hold authorities and certification bodies more accountable than farmers and retailers. For the direct effects, food safety concern is positively associated with behavior, whereas environmental concern is not. Policymakers shall use the results to narrow the motivation-behavior gap, especially for emerging economies.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Dong et al.&nbsp;(2022) explore the dynamics between motivation, perceived knowledge, and trust to address the persistent motivation-behavior gap in green consumption within the context of China’s food market. Employing the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework, they incorporate perceived knowledge and trust as mediators to understand the relationship between motivations and green food purchasing behavior. The study highlights that food safety concerns, a form of <em>egoistic motivation</em>, significantly drive green food purchasing behavior due to its alignment with personal health priorities. Conversely, environmental concerns, representing <em>altruistic motives</em>, have weaker and sometimes negative impacts on behavior. This disconnect is attributed to skepticism about agricultural practices and external, uncontrollable factors that complicate decision-making. <em>Perceived knowledge</em> plays a complex role as both a barrier and enabler. While detailed knowledge about certifications positively affects trust and behavior, knowledge about planting practices can deter purchases by raising awareness of agricultural pollution issues. Importantly, perceived knowledge alone does not directly influence behavior but mediates its effects through trust in the food supply chain. <em>Trust in institutional actors</em>, such as certification bodies and governmental authorities, is shown to significantly enhance green purchasing behavior. On the other hand, trust in farmers and retailers has negligible effects, highlighting the importance of systemic trust over personal relationships in this context. Dong et al.&nbsp;(2022) propose a <em>serial mediation model</em>, wherein motivations influence green behavior indirectly through perceived knowledge and trust. The findings underscore the need for transparent communication and robust certification systems to build consumer confidence, particularly in contexts where food safety is a critical concern. This work contributes to the literature by expanding the MOA framework to include trust as a critical determinant of green behavior and demonstrating the nuanced roles of different types of knowledge. It offers actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to bridge the motivation-behavior gap by addressing both cognitive and affective factors in consumer decision-making.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Purpose: Although the organic market has expanded in recent years, it remains small. Some researchers argue that consumers’ lack of knowledge concerning organic food is an important factor slowing down growth. This paper aims to focus on the factors influencing objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production and the relationship between both types of knowledge and consumer attitudes and motivations towards organic food and its consumption. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review is presented, relating to the impact of knowledge on behaviour in general and, more specifically, on organic food consumption. Several hypotheses are formulated concerning the relationship between objective and subjective knowledge, attitudes and organic food consumption and these are tested on organic vegetable consumption in Flanders (Belgium). Multiple regression models, a probit model and an analysis of variance are applied to a sample of 529 completed questionnaires (response rate=44 per cent). The respondents were selected in January 2007 using a convenience sampling technique. Socio-demographic variables are used to check representativeness. Findings: In the sample, the level of objective knowledge regarding organic vegetables is high. Attitudes towards the consumption of organic vegetables are generally positive. The strongest motivations for consuming organic vegetables are that they are produced without synthetic pesticides, are better for the environment, healthier, of higher quality and taste better. The strongest perceived barriers are overly high prices and lack of availability. Objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production show a positive correlation. Higher levels of objective and subjective knowledge concerning organic food are positively related to a more positive attitude towards organic food, greater experience of it and a more frequent use of information. Membership of an “ecological organisation” (VELT) is also related to higher levels of knowledge. Some variables have a significant positive relationship with subjective knowledge, but not with objective knowledge. Attitude is significantly and positively influenced by subjective knowledge, VELT-membership, norm, motivations and female gender. Perceived barriers have a significant negative influence on attitude. The likelihood of consuming organic vegetables is significantly and positively influenced by VELT-membership, subjective knowledge, attitude, motivations and the presence of children in the household. Whilst objective knowledge, norm and female gender have a significantly positive influence on attitude towards organic vegetables, they have no significant influence on the likelihood of actually consuming organic vegetables. Originality/value: Whilst several researchers argue that knowledge may be a very important factor in increasing organic food consumption, few have studied the mechanisms behind it. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper describing the impact of knowledge on organic food consumption in such detail. By assessing the impact of knowledge, as well as other factors, on organic food consumption, greater insight is gained with regard to organic food consumption behaviour.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Aertsens et al.&nbsp;(2011) explore the interplay between subjective and objective knowledge and consumer motivations in the context of organic food consumption. Their study provides critical insights into how knowledge types interact with motivational constructs to shape attitudes and behaviors toward sustainable practices. Both <em>subjective (self-assessed) and objective (factual) knowledge</em> play significant roles in reinforcing key motivations for organic consumption, including health benefits, environmental preservation, and product quality. <em>Motivations</em> rooted in altruistic (e.g., environmental concerns) and egoistic (e.g., health and quality) factors are positively associated with higher levels of both knowledge types. However, subjective knowledge exerts a stronger influence, reflecting the critical role of confidence in perceived expertise. This suggests that individuals who perceive themselves as knowledgeable are better equipped to align their motivations with their attitudes and behaviors. Subjective and objective knowledge contribute differently to the motivation-behavior pathway. Subjective knowledge, which incorporates self-confidence, enhances the perceived feasibility and desirability of organic consumption, thereby directly bridging the gap between motivational intentions and behavior. In contrast, objective knowledge indirectly supports this pathway by informing and strengthening motivational attitudes. While objective knowledge provides factual clarity, it is subjective knowledge that translates this understanding into actionable behaviors by fostering confidence in decision-making. The findings further suggest that knowledge mediates the relationship between motivations and attitudes. Motivated consumers with higher subjective knowledge are more likely to hold positive attitudes toward organic food, which, in turn, significantly increase their likelihood of adopting sustainable consumption behaviors. This underscores the importance of knowledge as both a driver and an enabler in the motivation-attitude-behavior sequence. Aertsens et al.&nbsp;(2011) identify a potential feedback loop wherein higher motivation drives information-seeking behavior, increasing objective knowledge. This growth in objective understanding feeds back into subjective knowledge, creating a reinforcing cycle that sustains and amplifies motivational influences. This dynamic highlights the interplay between motivational and cognitive constructs as an ongoing process.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become the fastest-growing waste stream, and consumer WEEE recycling is detrimental to the success of circular economy principles. However, consumer awareness of and willingness to cooperate in WEEE recycling is a core pillar of success as end users determine the ultimate fate of waste. This study presents the results of a survey distributed via social media in Portugal (n = 509) to determine consumer knowledge of and compliance or noncompliance with circular economy goals for WEEE as well as actionable insights for policy decision-makers and managers. Results show that the overall knowledge of WEEE posing health and environmental hazards is very high and that higher storage rates at home exist in younger demographics, students, and higher-income brackets. Our research highlights that not only are proximity to a recycling center and awareness of the location influencing factors required for recycling but also that recycling activities are mostly based on intrinsic motivation to protect the environment, with financial incentives only attracting a relatively small share of the study participants. While most studies on WEEE focus on developing countries, this study offers a distinct perspective by covering a mature EU economy.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Weilage et al.&nbsp;(2024) investigate the interplay between consumer motivation and knowledge in the context of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling in Portugal, emphasizing its implications for advancing a circular economy. Their research is particularly significant given the increasing volume of e-waste and the critical role consumers play in its management. The study reveals a high level of awareness among Portuguese consumers regarding the health and environmental hazards associated with WEEE. However, despite this <em>knowledge</em>, actual compliance with recycling practices remains inconsistent. The authors note that younger demographics, particularly students and individuals from higher-income brackets, tend to store more e-waste at home rather than recycle it. This suggests that while knowledge exists, it does not necessarily translate into action. The findings indicate that intrinsic <em>motivation</em>—specifically, a desire to protect the environment—drives most recycling behaviors. Financial incentives appear to have a limited impact on encouraging recycling among participants. This intrinsic motivation highlights the importance of fostering a sense of responsibility towards environmental sustainability as a means to enhance recycling rates. Weilage et al.&nbsp;(2024) emphasize the role of facilitating conditions in promoting effective recycling behaviors. Awareness of recycling centers is identified as a critical factor influencing consumer action. The study suggests that many consumers may not utilize established recycling systems due to a lack of knowledge about their existence or accessibility. Therefore, improving public awareness through targeted campaigns could significantly enhance participation in WEEE recycling initiatives. The insights from Weilage et al.&nbsp;(2024) provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and organizations involved in waste management. By identifying gaps in consumer knowledge and motivation, stakeholders can develop strategies that not only enhance awareness but also align with the intrinsic values of consumers to encourage more sustainable behaviors. The study advocates for comprehensive public education campaigns that highlight both the importance of recycling and the specific actions consumers can take to participate effectively in WEEE management.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ We aim to identify influences on UK citizens’ household food waste recycling as a basis for designing strategies to increase household food waste collection rates via local services. Using a UK dataset (n = 1801) and the COM-B (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) model as a theoretical framework, we conduct quantitative regression and supporting thematic analyses to investigate influences on citizens’ recycling of food waste. Results show that automatic motivation (e.g., emotions and habit) and psychological capability (e.g., knowledge) predict household food waste recycling. Physical opportunity (i.e., dealing with food waste in other ways such as home-composting or feeding pets/strays, time and financial costs) was the main barrier to recycling food waste identified in thematic analyses. Participants also reported automatic motivation-related barriers such as concerns over pests, odour, hygiene and local authorities’ food waste collection capabilities. Based on findings we recommend the development of clear, consistent communications aimed at creating positive social norms relating to recycling and increasing knowledge of what can and cannot be put in food waste bins. Improved functional design and free distribution of bins and compostable caddy liners developed according to user-centred needs for cleanliness, convenience and hygiene are also needed. These will not be sufficient without a nationally uniform, efficient and reliable system of household food waste collection.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Allison et al.&nbsp;(2022) explore the interplay of motivation and knowledge in the context of food waste recycling among UK citizens, employing a mixed-methods approach grounded in the COM-B (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) model. Their research highlights critical barriers and enablers influencing household food waste recycling behaviors, aiming to inform strategies for enhancing recycling rates. The study identifies <em>automatic motivation</em>—encompassing emotions and habitual behaviors—as a significant predictor of food waste recycling. Participants expressed concerns related to hygiene, pests, and odors, which acted as barriers to engaging in recycling practices. These automatic motivations reveal that emotional responses can significantly influence behavior, often overshadowing rational knowledge about the benefits of recycling. Psychological capability, particularly <em>knowledge</em> regarding what constitutes recyclable food waste, is also highlighted as a crucial factor. The authors found that increased knowledge correlates positively with recycling behaviors; however, many participants lacked clarity on acceptable materials for food waste bins. This gap in knowledge suggests that educational interventions could enhance recycling rates by providing clear guidelines on proper waste segregation. The research emphasizes physical opportunity as a primary barrier to effective food waste recycling. Participants reported alternative disposal methods such as home composting or feeding pets as more convenient than using designated food waste bins. Additionally, logistical challenges, including the design and availability of collection services, hindered participation in recycling programs. To address these challenges, the authors recommend several strategies: enhancing public communication to foster positive social norms around food waste recycling, increasing knowledge about what can be recycled, and improving the design and accessibility of recycling bins. They emphasize the necessity for a nationally uniform and efficient food waste collection system to facilitate widespread adoption of recycling behaviors.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ This paper aimed to explore knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of women towards the municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Tehran, Iran, to provide a basis for experts and decision-makers to develop or improve practical waste management strategies. Women’s contribution could markedly promote accomplishment of MSW management strategies, which has been neglected in many developing countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two stages: first, a random sample of 384 respondent women was selected from the 22 urban districts of Tehran, then 64 of them were randomly selected and trained face-to-face. The second phase was aimed at determining the effectiveness of face-to-face training and its impact on women’s performance in waste management. In both stages, data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions in four categories. Chi square (χ2) and Pearson correlation tests were applied to identify the association among variables. Results indicated that 69.6% and 72.9% of the women had adequate knowledge and attitude, respectively, while only 46.0% performed moderate practice on MSW management. Overall, significant association between education level, occupation, and marital status of the women with KAP towards reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of MSW were yielded (p &lt; 0.05). Adequate knowledge and positive attitude did not necessarily lead to the proper practice in this study. However, face-to-face training positively affected women’s practice in solid waste recycling and source separation. Conducting training programs and motivation of women by municipalities and decision-makers to elevate women’s environmental performance could substantially promote MSW management strategies in developing nations.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Zand et al.&nbsp;(2020) investigate the complex interplay between motivation and knowledge in the context of sustainable consumer behaviors, specifically focusing on the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a quantitative survey methodology, the study examines how various motivational factors, alongside consumers’ knowledge levels, influence their intention to purchase energy-efficient products. The research identifies <em>intrinsic motivation</em>—such as personal values related to environmental stewardship—as a significant driver of intention to adopt energy-efficient technologies. Participants who reported stronger intrinsic motivations were more likely to express intentions to purchase such products. Additionally, <em>extrinsic motivations</em>, including financial incentives and social approval, were found to play a complementary role, particularly among consumers with lower intrinsic motivation. Zand et al.&nbsp;(2020) highlight that <em>knowledge</em> significantly enhances consumers’ capability to engage in sustainable behaviors. Specifically, a higher level of knowledge regarding the benefits and functionalities of energy-efficient technologies correlates positively with the intention to purchase these products. However, the study also reveals that mere awareness is insufficient; understanding how to implement these technologies effectively is crucial for motivating action. The authors emphasize the dynamic relationship between motivation and knowledge. They found that knowledge not only serves as a facilitator for informed decision-making but also interacts with motivational factors to shape consumer behavior. For instance, individuals with high intrinsic motivation who possess detailed knowledge about energy-efficient options are more likely to overcome barriers to adoption compared to those with similar levels of knowledge but lower motivation. Based on their findings, Zand et al.&nbsp;(2020) recommend targeted interventions that enhance both motivation and knowledge among consumers. They suggest that educational programs should not only inform consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency but also foster intrinsic motivations by connecting these technologies to broader environmental values. Furthermore, policies that provide financial incentives can effectively complement educational efforts by addressing extrinsic motivations.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g.&nbsp;institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g.&nbsp;motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002) explored the complex relationship between motivation, knowledge, and pro-environmental behavior, addressing the persistent “value-action gap.” Their findings challenge the assumption that increased environmental knowledge directly leads to environmentally responsible actions, highlighting a more intricate interplay of factors. The study found that <em>environmental knowledge</em> is necessary but insufficient for fostering pro-environmental behavior. While basic awareness of environmental issues can guide action, a deeper technical understanding does not significantly enhance environmentally responsible behavior. Instead, knowledge serves as a modifier, shaping attitudes and values rather than acting as a direct catalyst for behavior. <em>Motivation</em> plays a critical role in determining behavior but is influenced by a combination of internal and external factors. Primary motives, such as altruistic and social values, often drive overarching environmental lifestyles. However, these are frequently overridden by selective motives, such as comfort, cost savings, or convenience, which dictate specific actions. The authors emphasize that situational factors, such as economic constraints, institutional barriers, and social norms, often obstruct the translation of motivation and knowledge into action. Additionally, psychological barriers, such as denial, apathy, and emotional detachment, further hinder pro-environmental behavior, even among those with strong environmental values and awareness. Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002) argue that the most significant positive influence on pro-environmental behavior occurs when internal factors (e.g., values, attitudes) and external factors (e.g., supportive infrastructure, economic incentives) act synergistically. For instance, individuals are more likely to adopt sustainable practices when they align with their values and are facilitated by accessible systems.</p>

MASEM results confirm that pro-environmental behavioural intention mediate the impact of all other psycho-social variables on pro-environmental behaviour (27% explained variance). Results also confirm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52% explained variance).

<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Bamberg and Möser (2007) conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate psycho-social determinants of pro-environmental behavior and tested a theoretical model integrating motivation and knowledge. Their findings revealed that the formation and activation of pro-environmental intentions and behaviors depend on the interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social factors. <em>Knowledge</em>, particularly awareness of environmental problems, serves as an essential precondition for pro-environmental behavior but exerts its influence indirectly. It shapes moral norms and attitudes by fostering internal attributions of responsibility, feelings of guilt, and adherence to social norms. <em>Motivation</em>, operationalized through moral norms and behavioral intention, mediates the relationship between knowledge and actual behavior. The study confirmed that behavioral intention is the strongest direct predictor of pro-environmental actions, explaining 27% of the variance in behavior. Moral norms, influenced by cognitive factors (e.g., problem awareness) and emotional responses (e.g., guilt), significantly predict these intentions, highlighting the role of personal responsibility. Despite strong intentions, situational factors such as perceived behavioral control (PBC) and structural constraints often limit the translation of motivation into action. Knowledge enhances perceived control and attitudes, making individuals more likely to act when external conditions are supportive. Their structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis supported an integrative framework where knowledge indirectly impacts pro-environmental behavior by shaping motivational constructs like moral norms and intention. The study emphasized the importance of combining educational efforts with structural and contextual interventions to bridge the gap between intention and action.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ The present paper argues for three reasons why knowledge’s influence on ecological behavior is underestimated systematically. First, it is not the mere amount of knowledge available that determines behavior. Different forms of knowledge must work together in a convergent manner if they are to foster ecological behavior. Second, knowledge’s effect remains undetected also, because some statistical procedures neither correct for measurement error attenuation nor uncover mediated influences accurately. Third, psychological factors such as knowledge apparently have a limited influence on ecological behavior when strong situational constraints are effective. When an ecological behavior measure makes—as a performance test—systematic use of situational influences though, knowledge can be revealed as affecting ecological behavior significantly.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ The role of knowledge in influencing ecological behavior has been widely studied, with Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) offering a comprehensive framework that highlights the importance of integrating various types of knowledge. Their work identifies <em>four forms of knowledge</em> that contribute to ecological behavior: declarative, procedural, effectiveness, and social knowledge. Declarative knowledge, which pertains to understanding environmental systems (e.g., the impact of greenhouse gases on climate), is essential for reducing uncertainty but has limited direct influence on behavior. Procedural knowledge, involving action-oriented skills such as recycling or conserving energy, facilitates ecological actions but often shows moderate predictive power. Effectiveness knowledge, which enables individuals to assess the relative impact of different behaviors (e.g., choosing energy-efficient appliances over curtailing driving), is crucial for informed decision-making. Finally, social knowledge, encompassing awareness of social norms and others’ behaviors, shapes actions by fostering compliance and avoiding social disapproval. Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) emphasize that these types of knowledge must converge to effectively promote ecological behavior. While individual forms of knowledge may influence actions to some extent, their integration is necessary to overcome barriers and enable consistent pro-environmental practices. Moreover, they highlight that the relationship between knowledge and behavior is mediated by factors such as attitudes, intentions, and social norms. Traditional statistical methods often fail to account for these mediating effects, leading to an underestimation of knowledge’s indirect influence. To address this, the authors advocate for structural equation modeling, which better captures the distal effects of knowledge on behavior. Additionally, the study underscores the role of situational constraints. While strong external barriers can diminish the influence of knowledge, reducing these barriers allows knowledge to become a significant predictor of ecological behavior. These findings suggest that interventions should combine efforts to reduce situational constraints with educational strategies that integrate declarative, procedural, and effectiveness knowledge.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ We review the personal and social influences on pro-environmental concern and behaviour, with an emphasis on recent research. The number of these influences suggests that understanding pro-environmental concern and behaviour is far more complex than previously thought. The influences are grouped into 18 personal and social factors. The personal factors include childhood experience, knowledge and education, personality and self-construal, sense of control, values, political and world views, goals, felt responsibility, cognitive biases, place attachment, age, gender and chosen activities. The social factors include religion, urban–rural differences, norms, social class, proximity to problematic environmental sites and cultural and ethnic variations We also recognize that pro-environmental behaviour often is undertaken based on none of the above influences, but because individuals have non-environmental goals such as to save money or to improve their health. Finally, environmental outcomes that are a result of these influences undoubtedly are determined by combinations of the 18 categories. Therefore, a primary goal of researchers now should be to learn more about how these many influences moderate and mediate one another to determine pro-environmental behaviour.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Gifford and Nilsson (2014) provide a comprehensive review of the personal and social factors influencing pro-environmental concern and behavior, emphasizing the interplay between motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the complexity of environmental behavior and challenge simplistic models that fail to account for the multifaceted influences. <em>Environmental knowledge</em> is a critical yet insufficient driver of pro-environmental behavior. It provides the cognitive basis for awareness and informed decision-making, but knowledge alone does not guarantee action. Gifford and Nilsson (2014) underscore that while accurate knowledge about environmental problems and solutions is essential, its impact is often mediated by values, attitudes, and external circumstances. <em>Motivation</em>, particularly when rooted in values such as biospheric or altruistic concerns, mediates the effect of knowledge on behavior. Individuals who are motivated by a sense of moral obligation or responsibility are more likely to act on their knowledge, translating awareness into tangible pro-environmental actions. The review identifies several psychological and contextual barriers that impede the relationship between motivation, knowledge, and behavior. These include cognitive biases, such as denial or apathy, as well as situational constraints, such as inadequate infrastructure or competing priorities. Overcoming these barriers requires interventions that not only enhance knowledge but also address motivational and structural obstacles. Gifford and Nilsson (2014) argue that pro-environmental behavior emerges from the dynamic interplay of personal factors (e.g., values, locus of control, and self-efficacy) and social influences (e.g., norms and cultural context). Interventions that combine educational efforts with motivational and structural support are more effective in fostering sustainable behavior.</p>

<p>/<em>Abstract</em>/ Variables that predict “green buying” (i.e., buying products that are environmentally beneficial) were investigated. Predictor variables included awareness about environmental impacts of products, specific environmental beliefs of consumers, several general environmental attitude scales, demographic variables, and several proenvironment behaviors other than buying behavior. A written questionnaire, mailed to randomly selected residents of 8 middle-class communities in the Los Angeles area, was answered by 201 respondents. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the hypotheses under study: Specific consumer beliefs predicted several green-buying variables as well as general environmental attitudes, whereas general environmental attitudes predicted only one aspect of green buying. Women were significantly higher than men on two aspects of green buying and on the environmental attitude scales. Home ownership was positively related to recycling behavior.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Mainieri et al.&nbsp;(1997) examined the factors influencing environmentally conscious purchasing, or “green buying,” and explored the interplay between motivation and knowledge in shaping these behaviors. Their findings reveal the nuanced roles of consumer beliefs, attitudes, and demographic factors in fostering pro-environmental actions. The study found that while awareness of environmental impacts provides a foundation for green buying, it is not a direct predictor of environmentally conscious purchasing. Many respondents reported confusion about environmental claims, which limited their ability to act on their <em>knowledge</em>. This highlights the need for clearer and more trustworthy information to bridge the gap between awareness and behavior. Consumer beliefs, reflecting specific pro-environmental <em>motivations</em> (e.g., avoiding harmful products or prioritizing environmental safety), were the strongest predictors of green buying behaviors. These beliefs significantly influenced the number and type of environmentally friendly products purchased and the degree to which environmental safety impacted purchasing decisions. General environmental attitudes, in contrast, had limited predictive power for specific green buying behaviors. Despite expressing pro-environmental attitudes, many respondents did not translate these motivations into consistent purchasing behaviors. This disconnect was attributed to structural barriers, such as the availability, affordability, and labeling of green products. These factors often outweighed knowledge and motivation, underscoring the importance of addressing external constraints to enable sustainable consumer choices. Women were found to be more likely than men to engage in green buying, recycling, and other pro-environmental behaviors. However, other demographic variables, such as age, income, and education, were not significantly related to green buying, reflecting a demographic shift toward broader environmental concern across diverse groups. Mainieri et al.&nbsp;(1997) conclude that enhancing consumer beliefs and addressing structural barriers are critical for promoting green consumerism. Their findings highlight the importance of aligning motivation and knowledge with supportive external conditions to foster pro-environmental purchasing behaviors.</p>

It is therefore relevant to understand the factors behind people’s sustainable behavior. Several psychological frameworks emphasize the role of motivation in sustainable behavior. We conducted a review of the literature to examine the motivation–sustainability relationship, with the following objectives: (1) explore consumers’ perception of the value conveyed by green products or services; (2) understand the factors that modulate the relationship between motivation and sustainable behavior; and (3) provide avenues for future research in psychology and formulate recommendations for application. The review of the results from 40 publications indicates that the symbolic value associated with green products or services can influence consumers’ preferences, choices, and sustainable behaviors. However, the perceived value of green products or services is modulated by dispositional factors, those specific to the characteristics and history of an individual, and contextual factors, those specific to a product being evaluated or the context in which the evaluation takes place. The results are discussed in light of the motivational, emotional, and attentional processes involved in sustainable behavior.</p>
<p>/<em>Potentially useful summary</em>/ Mastria et al.&nbsp;(2023) reviewed the psychological mechanisms underlying sustainable consumer behavior, emphasizing the interplay of motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the significance of green perceived value and its influence on consumer choices, preferences, and actions. The concept of green perceived value, defined as the net benefit of a product based on environmental desires and sustainability expectations, plays a central role in motivating sustainable behavior. However, consumers’ understanding of product claims (e.g., eco-labels) significantly moderates this relationship. Those with higher <em>knowledge</em> about sustainability are more likely to value and act upon green information, demonstrating stronger purchase intentions for environmentally friendly products. Intrinsic <em>motivation</em>, such as the symbolic value associated with green products, and emotional engagement are pivotal in fostering pro-environmental behaviors. Consumers motivated by the desire to “do the right thing” or by pride in their sustainable actions exhibit stronger commitments to eco-friendly choices. Furthermore, emotional appeals, particularly those framing environmental consequences negatively, were found to enhance motivation by evoking feelings of guilt or shame. Despite positive attitudes toward sustainability, many consumers face barriers such as insufficient knowledge, unclear product claims, and external constraints (e.g., price and availability). These obstacles contribute to the intention-behavior gap, where motivation and knowledge fail to translate into sustainable actions. Mastria et al.&nbsp;(2023) recommend integrating educational initiatives to improve sustainability knowledge with motivational strategies that leverage emotional and symbolic incentives. Tailored communication, such as message framing based on product type (positive for essentials, negative for non-essentials), and clearer eco-labeling could enhance the impact of green perceived value and encourage consistent sustainable behaviors.</p>

<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Globally, waste volumes are increasing rapidly and the World Bank estimates a 70% global increase in municipal solid waste up to 2025. Waste may have serious environmental consequences and there is a strong correlation between solid waste generation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. These two observations alone indicate that this development is not sustainable. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the environmental impact of waste. While, waste recycling in OECD countries is reported to be approximately 22% on average, many developing countries have recycling rates in the range of 1–3%. A key aspect in succeeding with any recycling effort is how authorities and other actors relate to both informal and formal waste workers. This paper reports on the findings of a systematic literature study with the aim of exploring waste recycling behavior, with a special focus on motivational factors, both physical and psychological, behind recycling. Three levels of descending importance for recycling have been identified, where two are vital for success, and the third is desirable; 1) a well-designed infrastructure for recycling 2) specific recycling knowledge, and, 3) a general understanding of environmental aspects. Any attempt to implement or improve recycling systems and/or recycling behavior, needs to consider these aspects and the insights gained through this research may provide decision makers with practical assistance. The paper also contributes by providing academia with a framework for further studies on the behavioral aspects of recycling.</span>

<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Johansson (2016) proposes a model that highlights the interplay between individuals' willingness to recycle and the external conditions that facilitate or hinder recycling efforts. The model underscores the importance of both psychological factors and systemic infrastructure in shaping recycling behaviors.</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_Committed recyclers_ exhibit both high motivation and access to simple recycling systems. Their actions are often driven by internal motivators such as environmental values, altruism, or guilt, as well as external pressures like social norms or incentives. This group actively incorporates recycling into their daily routines, making it an intentional and consistent practice.</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In contrast, _uncommitted recyclers_ demonstrate low motivation but still engage in recycling due to the ease of the process. For this group, the presence of highly accessible and straightforward systems, such as curbside collection, ensures participation even in the absence of strong environmental beliefs. Their behavior is largely habitual and reliant on external simplicity rather than internal conviction.</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_Involuntary non-recyclers_ are individuals who are motivated to recycle but face significant external barriers, such as limited access to facilities, inadequate infrastructure, or unclear instructions. These barriers hinder their ability to act on their environmental intentions, suggesting that targeted interventions to reduce these obstacles could activate their latent motivation to recycle.</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Finally, _uncommitted non-recyclers_ neither possess a strong belief in the importance of recycling nor have access to simple systems that encourage participation. This group is the least likely to engage in recycling, as they lack both internal motivators and external facilitators. Efforts to influence this group are most effective when systems are designed to make recycling as effortless as possible.</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Johansson’s (2016) model highlights the critical role of simplicity in recycling behavior, often outweighing the influence of motivation. While motivation can drive proactive efforts to seek out recycling opportunities, simplicity ensures broad participation by reducing the cognitive and physical barriers to action. These insights are invaluable for designing effective recycling programs, particularly in diverse populations where motivational levels and systemic support may vary.</span>

<span id="cb1-20"><a href="#cb1-20" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Purpose – A considerable amount of research suggests that the way information is processed may influence a purchasing decision; however, this seems to be an issue rarely investigated in green marketing studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to draw on the literature related to the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to provide a deeper insight into the factors affecting pro-environmental behavior intention.</span>
<span id="cb1-21"><a href="#cb1-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Design/methodology/approach – The framework highlights the moderator role of environmental motivation and environmental knowledge in the relationships among message framing and pro-environmental behavior intention. The study used an internet survey to help reduce the social desirability bias associated with a face-to-face survey. In total, 497 questionnaires were collected, of which 68 were invalid and 429 were valid.</span>
<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Findings – The results indicate that it might be beneficial for green marketing proprietors to provide product-related information stressing the potential negative consequences of not buying organic food products. This effect, however, is moderated by the degree of the customer’s environmental motivation and environmental knowledge.</span>

<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Chang and Wu (2015) examined how environmental motivation and knowledge influence the effectiveness of message framing in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Their study highlights the nuanced roles of these variables, revealing that motivation and knowledge interact to shape individuals' processing of environmental messages and their subsequent behavioral intentions.</span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For individuals with _high motivation and high environmental knowledge_, message framing (positive or negative) had minimal impact on pro-environmental behavior intentions. This group relies on heuristic processing due to their confidence and familiarity with environmental issues. Their established knowledge allows them to engage with environmental behaviors consistently, regardless of framing.</span>
<span id="cb1-28"><a href="#cb1-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In contrast, those with _high motivation but low environmental knowledge_ exhibited significant sensitivity to message framing. This group engaged in systematic processing, carefully evaluating the information presented. Negatively framed messages, which emphasize the adverse consequences of failing to act (e.g., environmental degradation), were particularly persuasive. The negativity bias, characterized by heightened attention to potential losses, drove stronger pro-environmental intentions in these individuals.</span>
<span id="cb1-29"><a href="#cb1-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For individuals with _low motivation_, environmental knowledge played a limited role in shaping behavior. Regardless of whether their knowledge was high or low, this group processed messages heuristically and exhibited minimal differences in response to positive or negative framing. Their lack of motivation hindered deeper engagement with the content.</span>
<span id="cb1-30"><a href="#cb1-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Overall, Chang and Wu (2015) suggest that message framing should be tailored to the target audience’s level of motivation and knowledge. Negative framing is particularly effective for motivating high-motivation, low-knowledge individuals, while for other groups, framing may have a lesser impact. These findings underscore the importance of understanding cognitive and emotional factors in designing effective environmental communication strategies.</span>

Hence, the present study used the goal-framing theory to explore the consumer’s motivational factors that derive sustainable consumption of organic food. Drawing on survey data of 488 respondents, the findings show that gain and hedonic motivations significantly affect purchase intentions; however, normative has an indirect role. In addition, the knowledge and perceived price significantly moderate the motivational factors.

<span id="cb1-49"><a href="#cb1-49" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This research explores the factors influencing consumers’ intentions and behaviors toward purchasing green products in two culturally and economically distinct countries, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Drawing on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study examines the roles of altruistic and egoistic motivations, alongside environmental knowledge, in shaping green consumer behavior. Altruistic motivation, driven by concern for societal well-being and environmental sustainability, is found to have a stronger impact on green purchase intention and behavior in both countries, particularly in Pakistan. Egoistic motivation, which focuses on personal benefits like health and cost savings, also contributes but with a lesser influence. The research employs a cross-sectional survey design, collecting data from 1000 respondents (500 from each country) using a stratified random sampling technique. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relationships between variables and test the moderating effects of environmental knowledge. The results reveal that environmental knowledge significantly moderates the effect of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green purchase intention, enhancing the likelihood of eco-friendly consumption. These findings underscore the importance of environmental education in promoting sustainable consumer behavior. The originality of this study lies in its comparative analysis of green consumerism in two distinct contexts and its exploration of motivational factors through the TPB framework. Practical implications suggest that policymakers and marketers can develop strategies that appeal to both altruistic and egoistic drivers while enhancing consumer knowledge of environmental issues. The study contributes to the literature by expanding TPB to include the moderating role of environmental knowledge in understanding green consumption behavior across diverse cultures.</span>

(2024) provides significant insights into the roles of motivation and environmental knowledge in promoting green consumer behavior, specifically examining two culturally distinct contexts: Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Using Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework, the study evaluates how altruistic and egoistic motivations interact with environmental knowledge to shape sustainable behaviors.</span>
<span id="cb1-53"><a href="#cb1-53" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The findings highlight that _altruistic motivation_—rooted in concern for collective well-being and societal ethics—plays a more dominant role in fostering green purchase intentions and behaviors than egoistic motivation in both countries. In particular, Pakistan demonstrates a stronger reliance on altruistic motives, reflecting cultural values that emphasize collective welfare. In contrast, _egoistic motivation_, tied to self-interest such as health benefits and cost savings, has a smaller but significant effect on green purchase intentions, particularly in Saudi Arabia.</span>
<span id="cb1-54"><a href="#cb1-54" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A critical contribution of the study is its exploration of _environmental knowledge_ as a moderator. It reveals that higher levels of environmental awareness enhance the impact of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green consumer behavior by improving individuals’ understanding of the benefits of eco-friendly products, reinforcing moral reasoning, and increasing perceived control over their actions. This moderation effect is more pronounced for altruistic motivation than egoistic motivation, emphasizing the importance of environmental education in driving sustainable practices.</span>
<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Moreover, the study notes contextual differences in motivational dynamics, with altruistic drivers aligning with societal ideals in Pakistan and egoistic factors, such as health benefits, resonating more in Saudi Arabia.

<span id="cb1-62"><a href="#cb1-62" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The motivations and barriers of the actual green purchase behavior are as real as the product itself, which makes it a systematic process to examine the inconsistency between consumers' motivations and their actual behavior (motivation-behavior gap). The study aimed to clarify the direct and indirect effects of motivations on the purchase behavior of green food. The proposed conceptual model was adopted from the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework and was extended by adding the serial mediation of consumer perceived knowledge and trust as major constructs. Data were collected from 1788 consumers in China. Results provided support for the model and showed that perceived knowledge about the food supply chain could be both barrier and a positive factor of consumers’ purchase behavior, which mainly depends on the trade-off between certification and planting knowledge. Differences in trust exist and consumers hold authorities and certification bodies more accountable than farmers and retailers. For the direct effects, food safety concern is positively associated with behavior, whereas environmental concern is not. Policymakers shall use the results to narrow the motivation-behavior gap, especially for emerging economies.</span>

<span id="cb1-66"><a href="#cb1-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The study highlights that food safety concerns, a form of _egoistic motivation_, significantly drive green food purchasing behavior due to its alignment with personal health priorities.

<span id="cb1-76"><a href="#cb1-76" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Purpose: Although the organic market has expanded in recent years, it remains small. Some researchers argue that consumers' lack of knowledge concerning organic food is an important factor slowing down growth. This paper aims to focus on the factors influencing objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production and the relationship between both types of knowledge and consumer attitudes and motivations towards organic food and its consumption.</span>
<span id="cb1-77"><a href="#cb1-77" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Design/methodology/approach: A literature review is presented, relating to the impact of knowledge on behaviour in general and, more specifically, on organic food consumption. Several hypotheses are formulated concerning the relationship between objective and subjective knowledge, attitudes and organic food consumption and these are tested on organic vegetable consumption in Flanders (Belgium). Multiple regression models, a probit model and an analysis of variance are applied to a sample of 529 completed questionnaires (response rate=44 per cent). The respondents were selected in January 2007 using a convenience sampling technique. Socio-demographic variables are used to check representativeness.</span>
<span id="cb1-78"><a href="#cb1-78" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Findings: In the sample, the level of objective knowledge regarding organic vegetables is high. Attitudes towards the consumption of organic vegetables are generally positive. The strongest motivations for consuming organic vegetables are that they are produced without synthetic pesticides, are better for the environment, healthier, of higher quality and taste better. The strongest perceived barriers are overly high prices and lack of availability. Objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production show a positive correlation. Higher levels of objective and subjective knowledge concerning organic food are positively related to a more positive attitude towards organic food, greater experience of it and a more frequent use of information. Membership of an "ecological organisation" (VELT) is also related to higher levels of knowledge. Some variables have a significant positive relationship with subjective knowledge, but not with objective knowledge. Attitude is significantly and positively influenced by subjective knowledge, VELT-membership, norm, motivations and female gender. Perceived barriers have a significant negative influence on attitude. The likelihood of consuming organic vegetables is significantly and positively influenced by VELT-membership, subjective knowledge, attitude, motivations and the presence of children in the household. Whilst objective knowledge, norm and female gender have a significantly positive influence on attitude towards organic vegetables, they have no significant influence on the likelihood of actually consuming organic vegetables.</span>
<span id="cb1-79"><a href="#cb1-79" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Originality/value: Whilst several researchers argue that knowledge may be a very important factor in increasing organic food consumption, few have studied the mechanisms behind it. To the authors' knowledge this is the first paper describing the impact of knowledge on organic food consumption in such detail. By assessing the impact of knowledge, as well as other factors, on organic food consumption, greater insight is gained with regard to organic food consumption behaviour.</span>

<span id="cb1-83"><a href="#cb1-83" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Both _subjective (self-assessed) and objective (factual) knowledge_ play significant roles in reinforcing key motivations for organic consumption, including health benefits, environmental preservation, and product quality. _Motivations_ rooted in altruistic (e.g., environmental concerns) and egoistic (e.g., health and quality) factors are positively associated with higher levels of both knowledge types. However, subjective knowledge exerts a stronger influence, reflecting the critical role of confidence in perceived expertise. This suggests that individuals who perceive themselves as knowledgeable are better equipped to align their motivations with their attitudes and behaviors.</span>
<span id="cb1-84"><a href="#cb1-84" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Subjective and objective knowledge contribute differently to the motivation-behavior pathway. Subjective knowledge, which incorporates self-confidence, enhances the perceived feasibility and desirability of organic consumption, thereby directly bridging the gap between motivational intentions and behavior. In contrast, objective knowledge indirectly supports this pathway by informing and strengthening motivational attitudes. While objective knowledge provides factual clarity, it is subjective knowledge that translates this understanding into actionable behaviors by fostering confidence in decision-making.</span>
<span id="cb1-85"><a href="#cb1-85" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The findings further suggest that knowledge mediates the relationship between motivations and attitudes. Motivated consumers with higher subjective knowledge are more likely to hold positive attitudes toward organic food, which, in turn, significantly increase their likelihood of adopting sustainable consumption behaviors. This underscores the importance of knowledge as both a driver and an enabler in the motivation-attitude-behavior sequence.</span>
<span id="cb1-86"><a href="#cb1-86" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Aertsens et al. (2011) identify a potential feedback loop wherein higher motivation drives information-seeking behavior, increasing objective knowledge. This growth in objective understanding feeds back into subjective knowledge, creating a reinforcing cycle that sustains and amplifies motivational influences. This dynamic highlights the interplay between motivational and cognitive constructs as an ongoing process.</span>

<span id="cb1-92"><a href="#cb1-92" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become the fastest-growing waste stream, and consumer WEEE recycling is detrimental to the success of circular economy principles. However, consumer awareness of and willingness to cooperate in WEEE recycling is a core pillar of success as end users determine the ultimate fate of waste. This study presents the results of a survey distributed via social media in Portugal (n = 509) to determine consumer knowledge of and compliance or noncompliance with circular economy goals for WEEE as well as actionable insights for policy decision-makers and managers. Results show that the overall knowledge of WEEE posing health and environmental hazards is very high and that higher storage rates at home exist in younger demographics, students, and higher-income brackets. Our research highlights that not only are proximity to a recycling center and awareness of the location influencing factors required for recycling but also that recycling activities are mostly based on intrinsic motivation to protect the environment, with financial incentives only attracting a relatively small share of the study participants. While most studies on WEEE focus on developing countries, this study offers a distinct perspective by covering a mature EU economy.</span>

(2024) investigate the interplay between consumer motivation and knowledge in the context of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling in Portugal, emphasizing its implications for advancing a circular economy. Their research is particularly significant given the increasing volume of e-waste and the critical role consumers play in its management.</span>
<span id="cb1-96"><a href="#cb1-96" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The study reveals a high level of awareness among Portuguese consumers regarding the health and environmental hazards associated with WEEE. However, despite this _knowledge_, actual compliance with recycling practices remains inconsistent. The authors note that younger demographics, particularly students and individuals from higher-income brackets, tend to store more e-waste at home rather than recycle it. This suggests that while knowledge exists, it does not necessarily translate into action.</span>
<span id="cb1-97"><a href="#cb1-97" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The findings indicate that intrinsic _motivation_—specifically, a desire to protect the environment—drives most recycling behaviors. Financial incentives appear to have a limited impact on encouraging recycling among participants. This intrinsic motivation highlights the importance of fostering a sense of responsibility towards environmental sustainability as a means to enhance recycling rates.</span>
<span id="cb1-98"><a href="#cb1-98" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Weilage et al. (2024) emphasize the role of facilitating conditions in promoting effective recycling behaviors. Awareness of recycling centers is identified as a critical factor influencing consumer action. The study suggests that many consumers may not utilize established recycling systems due to a lack of knowledge about their existence or accessibility. Therefore, improving public awareness through targeted campaigns could significantly enhance participation in WEEE recycling initiatives.</span>
<span id="cb1-99"><a href="#cb1-99" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The insights from Weilage et al. (2024) provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and organizations involved in waste management. By identifying gaps in consumer knowledge and motivation, stakeholders can develop strategies that not only enhance awareness but also align with the intrinsic values of consumers to encourage more sustainable behaviors. The study advocates for comprehensive public education campaigns that highlight both the importance of recycling and the specific actions consumers can take to participate effectively in WEEE management.</span>

Using a UK dataset (n = 1801) and the COM-B (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) model as a theoretical framework, we conduct quantitative regression and supporting thematic analyses to investigate influences on citizens’ recycling of food waste. Results show that automatic motivation (e.g., emotions and habit) and psychological capability (e.g., knowledge) predict household food waste recycling. Physical opportunity (i.e., dealing with food waste in other ways such as home-composting or feeding pets/strays, time and financial costs) was the main barrier to recycling food waste identified in thematic analyses. Participants also reported automatic motivation-related barriers such as concerns over pests, odour, hygiene and local authorities’ food waste collection capabilities. Based on findings we recommend the development of clear, consistent communications aimed at creating positive social norms relating to recycling and increasing knowledge of what can and cannot be put in food waste bins. Improved functional design and free distribution of bins and compostable caddy liners developed according to user-centred needs for cleanliness, convenience and hygiene are also needed. These will not be sufficient without a nationally uniform, efficient and reliable system of household food waste collection.</span>

Women’s contribution could markedly promote accomplishment of MSW management strategies, which has been neglected in many developing countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two stages: first, a random sample of 384 respondent women was selected from the 22 urban districts of Tehran, then 64 of them were randomly selected and trained face-to-face. The second phase was aimed at determining the effectiveness of face-to-face training and its impact on women’s performance in waste management. In both stages, data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions in four categories. Chi square (χ2) and Pearson correlation tests were applied to identify the association among variables. Results indicated that 69.6% and 72.9% of the women had adequate knowledge and attitude, respectively, while only 46.0% performed moderate practice on MSW management. Overall, significant association between education level, occupation, and marital status of the women with KAP towards reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of MSW were yielded (p &lt; 0.05). Adequate knowledge and positive attitude did not necessarily lead to the proper practice in this study. However, face-to-face training positively affected women’s practice in solid waste recycling and source separation. Conducting training programs and motivation of women by municipalities and decision-makers to elevate women’s environmental performance could substantially promote MSW management strategies in developing nations.</span>

<span id="cb1-132"><a href="#cb1-132" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).</span>

<span id="cb1-136"><a href="#cb1-136" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The study found that _environmental knowledge_ is necessary but insufficient for fostering pro-environmental behavior. While basic awareness of environmental issues can guide action, a deeper technical understanding does not significantly enhance environmentally responsible behavior.

<span id="cb1-137"><a href="#cb1-137" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_Motivation_ plays a critical role in determining behavior but is influenced by a combination of internal and external factors.

<span id="cb1-158"><a href="#cb1-158" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The present paper argues for three reasons why knowledge's influence on ecological behavior is underestimated systematically. First, it is not the mere amount of knowledge available that determines behavior. Different forms of knowledge must work together in a convergent manner if they are to foster ecological behavior. Second, knowledge's effect remains undetected also, because some statistical procedures neither correct for measurement error attenuation nor uncover mediated influences accurately. Third, psychological factors such as knowledge apparently have a limited influence on ecological behavior when strong situational constraints are effective. When an ecological behavior measure makes—as a performance test—systematic use of situational influences though, knowledge can be revealed as affecting ecological behavior significantly.</span>

<span id="cb1-161"><a href="#cb1-161" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The role of knowledge in influencing ecological behavior has been widely studied, with Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) offering a comprehensive framework that highlights the importance of integrating various types of knowledge. Their work identifies _four forms of knowledge_ that contribute to ecological behavior: declarative, procedural, effectiveness, and social knowledge.</span>
<span id="cb1-162"><a href="#cb1-162" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Declarative knowledge, which pertains to understanding environmental systems (e.g., the impact of greenhouse gases on climate), is essential for reducing uncertainty but has limited direct influence on behavior. Procedural knowledge, involving action-oriented skills such as recycling or conserving energy, facilitates ecological actions but often shows moderate predictive power. Effectiveness knowledge, which enables individuals to assess the relative impact of different behaviors (e.g., choosing energy-efficient appliances over curtailing driving), is crucial for informed decision-making. Finally, social knowledge, encompassing awareness of social norms and others’ behaviors, shapes actions by fostering compliance and avoiding social disapproval.</span>
<span id="cb1-163"><a href="#cb1-163" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) emphasize that these types of knowledge must converge to effectively promote ecological behavior. While individual forms of knowledge may influence actions to some extent, their integration is necessary to overcome barriers and enable consistent pro-environmental practices. Moreover, they highlight that the relationship between knowledge and behavior is mediated by factors such as attitudes, intentions, and social norms. Traditional statistical methods often fail to account for these mediating effects, leading to an underestimation of knowledge’s indirect influence. To address this, the authors advocate for structural equation modeling, which better captures the distal effects of knowledge on behavior.</span>
<span id="cb1-164"><a href="#cb1-164" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Additionally, the study underscores the role of situational constraints. While strong external barriers can diminish the influence of knowledge, reducing these barriers allows knowledge to become a significant predictor of ecological behavior. These findings suggest that interventions should combine efforts to reduce situational constraints with educational strategies that integrate declarative, procedural, and effectiveness knowledge.</span>

<span id="cb1-170"><a href="#cb1-170" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We review the personal and social influences on pro-environmental concern and behaviour, with an emphasis on recent research. The number of these influences suggests that understanding pro-environmental concern and behaviour is far more complex than previously thought. The influences are grouped into 18 personal and social factors. The personal factors include childhood experience, knowledge and education, personality and self-construal, sense of control, values, political and world views, goals, felt responsibility, cognitive biases, place attachment, age, gender and chosen activities. The social factors include religion, urban–rural differences, norms, social class, proximity to problematic environmental sites and cultural and ethnic variations We also recognize that pro-environmental behaviour often is undertaken based on none of the above influences, but because individuals have non-environmental goals such as to save money or to improve their health. Finally, environmental outcomes that are a result of these influences undoubtedly are determined by combinations of the 18 categories. Therefore, a primary goal of researchers now should be to learn more about how these many influences moderate and mediate one another to determine pro-environmental behaviour.</span>

<span id="cb1-173"><a href="#cb1-173" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Gifford and Nilsson (2014) provide a comprehensive review of the personal and social factors influencing pro-environmental concern and behavior, emphasizing the interplay between motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the complexity of environmental behavior and challenge simplistic models that fail to account for the multifaceted influences.</span>
<span id="cb1-174"><a href="#cb1-174" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_Environmental knowledge_ is a critical yet insufficient driver of pro-environmental behavior. It provides the cognitive basis for awareness and informed decision-making, but knowledge alone does not guarantee action. Gifford and Nilsson (2014) underscore that while accurate knowledge about environmental problems and solutions is essential, its impact is often mediated by values, attitudes, and external circumstances.</span>
<span id="cb1-175"><a href="#cb1-175" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_Motivation_, particularly when rooted in values such as biospheric or altruistic concerns, mediates the effect of knowledge on behavior. Individuals who are motivated by a sense of moral obligation or responsibility are more likely to act on their knowledge, translating awareness into tangible pro-environmental actions.</span>
<span id="cb1-176"><a href="#cb1-176" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The review identifies several psychological and contextual barriers that impede the relationship between motivation, knowledge, and behavior. These include cognitive biases, such as denial or apathy, as well as situational constraints, such as inadequate infrastructure or competing priorities. Overcoming these barriers requires interventions that not only enhance knowledge but also address motivational and structural obstacles.</span>
<span id="cb1-177"><a href="#cb1-177" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Gifford and Nilsson (2014) argue that pro-environmental behavior emerges from the dynamic interplay of personal factors (e.g., values, locus of control, and self-efficacy) and social influences (e.g., norms and cultural context). Interventions that combine educational efforts with motivational and structural support are more effective in fostering sustainable behavior.</span>

<span id="cb1-183"><a href="#cb1-183" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Variables that predict “green buying” (i.e., buying products that are environmentally beneficial) were investigated. Predictor variables included awareness about environmental impacts of products, specific environmental beliefs of consumers, several general environmental attitude scales, demographic variables, and several proenvironment behaviors other than buying behavior. A written questionnaire, mailed to randomly selected residents of 8 middle-class communities in the Los Angeles area, was answered by 201 respondents. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the hypotheses under study: Specific consumer beliefs predicted several green-buying variables as well as general environmental attitudes, whereas general environmental attitudes predicted only one aspect of green buying. Women were significantly higher than men on two aspects of green buying and on the environmental attitude scales. Home ownership was positively related to recycling behavior.</span>

<span id="cb1-186"><a href="#cb1-186" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Mainieri et al. (1997) examined the factors influencing environmentally conscious purchasing, or "green buying," and explored the interplay between motivation and knowledge in shaping these behaviors. Their findings reveal the nuanced roles of consumer beliefs, attitudes, and demographic factors in fostering pro-environmental actions.</span>
<span id="cb1-187"><a href="#cb1-187" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The study found that while awareness of environmental impacts provides a foundation for green buying, it is not a direct predictor of environmentally conscious purchasing. Many respondents reported confusion about environmental claims, which limited their ability to act on their _knowledge_. This highlights the need for clearer and more trustworthy information to bridge the gap between awareness and behavior.</span>
<span id="cb1-188"><a href="#cb1-188" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Consumer beliefs, reflecting specific pro-environmental _motivations_ (e.g., avoiding harmful products or prioritizing environmental safety), were the strongest predictors of green buying behaviors. These beliefs significantly influenced the number and type of environmentally friendly products purchased and the degree to which environmental safety impacted purchasing decisions. General environmental attitudes, in contrast, had limited predictive power for specific green buying behaviors.</span>
<span id="cb1-189"><a href="#cb1-189" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Despite expressing pro-environmental attitudes, many respondents did not translate these motivations into consistent purchasing behaviors. This disconnect was attributed to structural barriers, such as the availability, affordability, and labeling of green products. These factors often outweighed knowledge and motivation, underscoring the importance of addressing external constraints to enable sustainable consumer choices.</span>
<span id="cb1-190"><a href="#cb1-190" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Women were found to be more likely than men to engage in green buying, recycling, and other pro-environmental behaviors. However, other demographic variables, such as age, income, and education, were not significantly related to green buying, reflecting a demographic shift toward broader environmental concern across diverse groups.</span>
<span id="cb1-191"><a href="#cb1-191" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Mainieri et al. (1997) conclude that enhancing consumer beliefs and addressing structural barriers are critical for promoting green consumerism. Their findings highlight the importance of aligning motivation and knowledge with supportive external conditions to foster pro-environmental purchasing behaviors.</span>

<span id="cb1-197"><a href="#cb1-197" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Taking sustainable actions in daily life to reduce human impacts on the environment is becoming a matter of great urgency. It is therefore relevant to understand the factors behind people’s sustainable behavior. Several psychological frameworks emphasize the role of motivation in sustainable behavior. We conducted a review of the literature to examine the motivation–sustainability relationship, with the following objectives: (1) explore consumers’ perception of the value conveyed by green products or services; (2) understand the factors that modulate the relationship between motivation and sustainable behavior; and (3) provide avenues for future research in psychology and formulate recommendations for application. The review of the results from 40 publications indicates that the symbolic value associated with green products or services can influence consumers’ preferences, choices, and sustainable behaviors. However, the perceived value of green products or services is modulated by dispositional factors, those specific to the characteristics and history of an individual, and contextual factors, those specific to a product being evaluated or the context in which the evaluation takes place. The results are discussed in light of the motivational, emotional, and attentional processes involved in sustainable behavior.</span>

<span id="cb1-200"><a href="#cb1-200" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Mastria et al. (2023) reviewed the psychological mechanisms underlying sustainable consumer behavior, emphasizing the interplay of motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the significance of green perceived value and its influence on consumer choices, preferences, and actions.</span>
<span id="cb1-201"><a href="#cb1-201" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The concept of green perceived value, defined as the net benefit of a product based on environmental desires and sustainability expectations, plays a central role in motivating sustainable behavior. However, consumers’ understanding of product claims (e.g., eco-labels) significantly moderates this relationship. Those with higher _knowledge_ about sustainability are more likely to value and act upon green information, demonstrating stronger purchase intentions for environmentally friendly products.</span>
<span id="cb1-202"><a href="#cb1-202" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Intrinsic _motivation_, such as the symbolic value associated with green products, and emotional engagement are pivotal in fostering pro-environmental behaviors. Consumers motivated by the desire to “do the right thing” or by pride in their sustainable actions exhibit stronger commitments to eco-friendly choices. Furthermore, emotional appeals, particularly those framing environmental consequences negatively, were found to enhance motivation by evoking feelings of guilt or shame.</span>
<span id="cb1-203"><a href="#cb1-203" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Despite positive attitudes toward sustainability, many consumers face barriers such as insufficient knowledge, unclear product claims, and external constraints (e.g., price and availability). These obstacles contribute to the intention-behavior gap, where motivation and knowledge fail to translate into sustainable actions.</span>
<span id="cb1-204"><a href="#cb1-204" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Mastria et al. (2023) recommend integrating educational initiatives to improve sustainability knowledge with motivational strategies that leverage emotional and symbolic incentives. Tailored communication, such as message framing based on product type (positive for essentials, negative for non-essentials), and clearer eco-labeling could enhance the impact of green perceived value and encourage consistent sustainable behaviors.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button" data-in-quarto-modal=""><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
