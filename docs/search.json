    "text": "This notebook explores data from a multi-survey study investigating the relationships between sustainable behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes. The study involved participants completing five different surveys, each designed to measure different aspects of these constructs. This analysis focuses on understanding these relationships, with a particular emphasis on the connection between knowledge and motivation.\n\nThe dataset combines responses from five different surveys into a single data frame, structured such that each row represents a participant, and each column represents a response, or a derived score. The five underlying surveys are:\n\n\nEnergy Literacy Survey (ELS01-ELS08): Assesses participants’ knowledge of energy concepts through multiple-choice questions.\n\nAttari Energy Survey - Part 1:\n\n\nPerceived Difficulty Items (ATT01-ATT15): Measures how easy or hard participants would find it to adopt energy-saving behaviors, using a rating scale.\n\nNumeracy Questions (ATT16-ATT18): Assesses numerical literacy through probability questions requiring numeric answers.\n\n\n\nAttari Energy Survey - Part 2:\n\n\nRelative Energy Usage (ATT19-ATT27): Asks participants to estimate the relative energy usage of various devices compared to a 100-Watt bulb, using a numeric response format.\n\nRelative Energy Savings (ATT28-ATT33): Asks participants to estimate the relative energy savings of various actions compared to turning off a 100-Watt bulb, using a numeric response format.\n\n\n\nRecycling Study Questions (RS01-RS06): Assesses participants’ attitudes towards the environment and politics.",

In the generated plot, the elbow appears to be around 3 or 4 clusters.

It estimates how many latent subgroups exist and assigns group membership probabilistically. Longer-Form Mediation/SEM If you have theoretical pathways (e.g., knowledge → difficulty → attitude → behavior), a structural equation model (SEM) could test these sequential steps. You already have some code with the “lavaan” mediation example. Extending that to a more complete path model might be very revealing. Hotspot or Subgroup Analysis In addition to clustering, you might examine if there are meaningful thresholds on “knowledge” or “motivation” variables that matter for applied outcomes (e.g., does ELS &gt; X relate to seeing certain actions as less difficult?). A simple approach is the creation of “low vs. high” subgroups by a cut-point or quantile.\nAssessment of Current Analyses Below is a summary of the key findings and methods already performed, along with recommendations about which approaches most directly address your study’s main goals—namely, (1) assessing how different instruments relate to each other (knowledge vs. motivation measures) and (2) identifying clusters of participants who exhibit distinct knowledge–motivation profiles.\nPatterns in the Results Correlations Among Subscales The correlation matrices consistently indicate that the knowledge-based subscales (numeracy, energy-use estimates, energy-saving estimates, ELS score) tend to correlate with each other, reflecting a coherent “knowledge” dimension. Meanwhile, the motivation/attitude measures (perceived difficulty, environmental attitude, political conservatism) intercorrelate more strongly among themselves, forming a separate dimension. Nonetheless, moderate cross-correlations (e.g., environment attitude × ELS) do appear, suggesting knowledge and motivation are linked but not redundant. Factor Analyses (EFA/PCA) Factor analysis/PCA repeatedly shows that items load primarily on two factors: one dominated by knowledge-related scales, and one by motivational or attitudinal variables. This structure offers empirical support for the idea that “knowledge” vs. “motivation” are conceptually distinct constructs, even though they have modest correlations. Regression Analyses Various regressions indicate that motivation variables can predict or be predicted by knowledge measures (e.g., environment attitude is a positive predictor of ELS; perceived difficulty shows a negative association with certain knowledge scales). Some regressions add political conservatism or numeracy as control variables, improving understanding of how each knowledge measure links to attitudes. Cluster Analyses The K-means cluster analyses (and hierarchical clustering) create groupings of participants based on either (a) knowledge-only variables or (b) combined knowledge + motivation variables. When using knowledge-only variables, you can identify “low-, medium-, and high-knowledge” clusters. When you incorporate motivation variables, you see clusters that differ both in knowledge and motivation. Examining each cluster’s mean knowledge and motivation scores can reveal interesting subgroups (e.g., “High knowledge, moderate motivation”; “Low knowledge, high difficulty,” etc.). Interaction and Non-linear (GAM) Models Interaction models test whether the effect of one motivation variable on ELS (or vice versa) changes depending on another factor (e.g., interaction of perceived difficulty × environmental attitude). The GAM (generalized additive model) approach checks for non-linear relationships. Results so far suggest some modest curvatures but are not strongly highlighting a major non-linearity (based on the partial deviance explained). Most Useful Analyses for Your Goals Correlations + Factor Analysis These confirm that knowledge and motivation measures cluster into distinct but correlated dimensions. They also reveal whether certain items from separate instruments overlap more than expected. Regressions Linking Knowledge & Motivation Linear models (and potential moderation/mediation) clarify how knowledge predicts or relates to motivation outcomes: for instance, whether a higher ELS score is associated with stronger environmental attitudes. Cluster Analysis to Identify Subgroups K-means or hierarchical clustering with both knowledge and motivation variables is particularly useful for discovering distinct “profiles.” This approach aligns directly with your interest in grouping participants by patterns of knowledge–motivation. Inspecting cluster centers and cluster-specific means on each subscale reveals the different profiles and can guide subsequent targeted interventions or interpretations (e.g., “Cluster A is high-knowledge but low motivation,” etc.). Suggestions for Additional Informative Analyses Below are some optional but potentially valuable additions:\nProfile Comparison on External Variables If you have other outcomes (e.g., actual engagement in environmental behaviors, demographics, or political orientation beyond conservatism alone), compare them across the knowledge–motivation clusters. For example:\nOkay, let’s break down the analyses, highlight the most informative ones, and add some enhancements.\nAssessment of Current Analyses\nThe analyses performed provide a comprehensive exploration of the relationships between the survey instruments, particularly focusing on knowledge and motivation. Here’s a summary:\nStrengths:\nMulti-faceted Approach: The code employs a wide range of techniques:\nCorrelation Analysis: Examining pairwise relationships between variables.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): Exploring underlying latent factors among the subscales.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality and visualizing data in a lower-dimensional space.\nRegression Modeling: Predicting knowledge scores from motivation and vice-versa, as well as testing for interactions.\nCluster Analysis (K-means): Identifying groups of individuals with similar response patterns.\nGeneralized Additive Models (GAMs): Investigating potential non-linear relationships.\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM): Testing a hypothesized measurement and structural model.\nLatent Profile Analysis (LPA): Another approach to clustering that accounts for the probabilistic nature of group membership.\nVisualization: The use of corrplot, ggplot2, and fviz_cluster helps visualize the relationships and cluster structures, making the results more accessible.\nComposite Scores: Creating composite knowledge and motivation scores is a good practice for reducing dimensionality and potentially increasing reliability.\nModel Comparison: The code starts to compare different clustering solutions and regression models, which is crucial for finding the best-fitting and most interpretable models.\nWeaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\nRedundancy: Some analyses are repeated across different code blocks without clear justification. This can be streamlined.\nInterpretation: While the code produces a lot of output, there’s a lack of in-depth interpretation of the findings. More discussion is needed to connect the results back to the research questions.\nJustification of Choices: The number of factors in EFA, the number of clusters in K-means, and the specific variables included in some models could be better justified. Using techniques like scree plots, parallel analysis, the elbow method, and silhouette analysis should be more explicitly demonstrated.\nModel Evaluation: For the regression models, more attention could be paid to model diagnostics (e.g., checking for normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) and model fit statistics.\nCluster Validation: While some initial cluster validation is performed (e.g., comparing clusters on external variables), more robust methods like bootstrap resampling could be used to assess cluster stability.\nOutput Formatting: The output could be more organized and easier to read. Using packages like knitr, kableExtra, or gt for generating tables would be beneficial.\nMost Informative Analyses:\nBased on the stated goals, the following analyses are most informative:\nCorrelation Analysis (with Visualization): The correlation matrix (especially when visualized with corrplot) provides an initial overview of the relationships between all key variables. It helps to quickly see which knowledge and motivation measures are strongly associated.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): This analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the subscales. It helps determine whether knowledge and motivation are indeed distinct factors or if they load onto a single factor. The results suggest two or three factors, which is consistent with the theoretical framework.\nRegression Models Predicting Knowledge from Motivation (and vice versa): These models directly address the research question about the relationship between knowledge and motivation. The significant coefficients provide evidence for the strength and direction of these relationships.\nCluster Analysis (K-means and LPA): Clustering helps identify distinct groups of individuals based on their knowledge and motivation profiles. K-means provides a simpler, more intuitive approach, while LPA offers a more statistically rigorous method that accounts for measurement error. The analyses suggest there are identifiable groups with differing levels of knowledge and motivation.\nAssessment of Existing Methods\nData Loading and Preprocessing (Page 1)\nAppropriateness: This section is essential and well-executed. It loads necessary packages, sets options, sources functions, and reads in the raw survey data. The creation of combined datasets (e.g., aes_combined, att2_combined) is logical for further analysis.\nConcerns: None.\nCluster Analysis (Pages 2-3, 17-20, 25-27)\nAppropriateness: Cluster analysis is a valid approach to identify groups of subjects with similar response patterns. The use of the elbow method (fviz_nbclust) to determine the optimal number of clusters is standard practice. K-means clustering is a common and generally effective algorithm for this purpose.\nConcerns:\nScaling: The code scales the data before clustering, which is crucial for k-means, as it’s sensitive to variable scales.\nCluster Number: The elbow method often suggests a range rather than a single definitive number. The choice of 3 clusters seems reasonable based on the plots, but exploring 2, 4, or even 5 clusters might offer further insights.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of clusters should be cautious and data-driven. For instance, on page 27 “composite_motivation” seems to be mainly driven by the “perceived_difficulty” component, which might not capture the full picture of motivation.\nVisualization: The cluster visualizations are helpful, but adding confidence ellipses or convex hulls could enhance them.\nAlternative Algorithms: Exploring other clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering (pages 20-21) or model-based clustering (pages 34, 38), might be beneficial.\nFactor Analysis (Pages 4, 45-47)\nAppropriateness: Factor analysis is suitable for exploring the underlying structure of the survey instruments and identifying latent factors that explain the correlations between items. The use of fa function with varimax rotation is standard.\nConcerns:\nNumber of Factors: The scree plot (page 4) suggests two or three factors, but the analysis proceeds with two. Exploring a three-factor solution might reveal a more nuanced structure. On page 45, 5 factors are used, which might be too many given the number of items, potentially leading to overfitting. It’s good that this is noted in a comment, though.\nItem Loadings: Some items have low loadings on all factors, indicating they might not be well-explained by the identified factors.\nInterpretation: Factor interpretation should be based on the items with high loadings on each factor. The provided interpretation seems reasonable.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Given that there are likely some hypotheses about the structure of the instruments, CFA (using lavaan as started on page 47) would be a more appropriate method to test these hypotheses.\nEnhanced Regression Models (Page 5-6)\nAppropriateness: Regression models are useful for predicting one variable from others. The enhanced models on pages 5 and 6 explore the relationships between els_score (energy literacy) and other variables, including interaction terms.\nConcerns:\nMulticollinearity: Including highly correlated predictors (e.g., energy_use and energy_save) can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\nOverfitting: The models might be overfitting the data, especially with many predictors and interaction terms. Regularization techniques (e.g., LASSO or Ridge regression) could be considered.\nCausal Inference: The code uses causal language (“controlling for”), but these are observational data, and causal claims cannot be made without further assumptions and potentially different methods.\nInteraction Effects in Regression (Pages 6-7)\nAppropriateness: Examining interaction effects is important to understand how the relationship between two variables might change depending on the level of a third variable.\nConcerns: The visualization of the interaction on page 7 is helpful. However, the interpretation should be based on the statistical significance of the interaction term in the regression model.\nEnhanced Correlation Plot (Pages 8-9)\nAppropriateness: Correlation plots are excellent for visualizing the relationships between multiple variables. The use of corrplot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None. This is a well-executed and informative visualization.\nKnowledge Profile Clustering (Pages 10-11, 28)\nAppropriateness: Clustering based on knowledge-related variables is a good way to identify groups with different knowledge profiles.\nConcerns: The interpretation of these clusters should be data-driven and based on the mean scores of the variables within each cluster.\nNon-linear GAM Analysis (Pages 11-12, 14-15)\nAppropriateness: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are suitable for exploring non-linear relationships between variables. The code correctly uses gam function with smoothing terms.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: GAMs can overfit if the smoothing terms are too flexible. Model selection techniques (e.g., cross-validation) should be used to choose appropriate smoothing parameters.\nInterpretation: The plots on pages 14 are helpful for visualizing the non-linear relationships. The interpretation should be based on the shape of the smoothed curves and the statistical significance of the smooth terms.\nKnowledge-Motivation Interaction Analysis (Pages 12-13)\nAppropriateness: This analysis aims to explore how the relationship between knowledge and motivation might vary across individuals.\nConcerns: The code uses a linear model with an interaction term. However, a more flexible approach, such as a GAM with an interaction term, might be more appropriate to capture non-linear interactions.\nCluster Profile Analysis (Page 16)\nAppropriateness: Comparing cluster profiles based on mean scores of relevant variables is a standard and informative way to understand the characteristics of each cluster.\nConcerns: None.\nStructural Equation Model (Pages 31-33, 36-37, 42-44, 47-49)\nAppropriateness: SEM is a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships between observed and latent variables. It’s particularly useful for testing hypothesized models of how different constructs relate to each other. Given the goals of the study, SEM is a very appropriate method.\nConcerns:\nModel Specification: The specified model on page 31 seems reasonable as a starting point. However, it should be refined based on theoretical considerations and model fit statistics.\nModel Fit: The model fit statistics on pages 32, 37, 43, and 48 suggest that the initial models do not fit the data very well. Model modification should be considered, guided by modification indices and theoretical considerations.\nSample Size: SEM typically requires a large sample size. The sample size of 586 is decent but might be insufficient for complex models.\nMissing Data: The code uses FIML to handle missing data, which is a good approach.\nClassification Tree (Pages 33-34)\nAppropriateness: Classification trees can be useful for identifying subgroups based on a set of predictors.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: Trees can easily overfit, especially with many predictors. Pruning or using ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) might be necessary.\nInterpretability: While trees are generally interpretable, complex trees can be difficult to understand.\nLatent Profile Analysis (Pages 34-35, 38-41, 50)\nAppropriateness: LPA is a model-based clustering technique that can identify latent subgroups based on continuous variables. It’s a good alternative to k-means, especially when the clusters are not well-separated or have different shapes.\nConcerns:\nModel Selection: The BIC plot on page 35 suggests that the optimal number of classes is not clear-cut. Exploring different numbers of classes and examining the interpretability of the results is important.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of the latent profiles should be based on the mean scores of the variables within each profile.\nCluster Stability Assessment (Pages 51-54)\nAppropriateness: Assessing cluster stability is important to ensure that the identified clusters are not simply due to random chance or the specific algorithm used. The use of clusterboot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None.",

They found that normative feedback was most effective when targeting underperforming individuals. Their energy savings were modelled to be around 2-5% depending on who was targeted.\nChen, J., Taylor, J. E., & Wei, H. H. (2012).

In particular, they looked at network degree (one measure of the cohesion of the network) and weight. They propose that the use of models is useful for experimental designs that want to test interventions by giving them a baseline to compare their intervention to.\nFroehlich, J., Findlater, L., & Landay, J.

They report that investigations of feedback interventions should use baseline explorations, targeted rather than generalizable feedback, learning systems, and modelling to flesh out their analysis of interventions. Carlin, Ford, and McPherson (2015) is another one that looks at assessing behavior initiatives more broadly.\nFrederiks, E. R., Stenner, K., & Hobman, E. V. (2015).

While we will take our own perspectives to it, I think that these are useful for thinking about how to contextualize our findings and seeing how these perspectives would frame the tasks that we decide to have subjects do.\nBehavior impact on energy consumption. These studies conceptualizing and measuring various individual energy consumption behaviors. Studies not included in this bibliography mostly had to do with predicting and modelling occupancy in overall residential energy consumption.\nBarthelmes, V. M., Becchio, C., & Corgnati, S. P. (2016). Occupant behavior lifestyles in a residential nearly zero energy building: Effect on energy use and thermal comfort. Science and Technology for the Built Environment, 22(7), 960–975. http://doi.org/10.1080/23744731.2016.1197758 This study modelled how high, medium, and low consumption users would impact energy consumption in a sustainable house. While the findings (how consumption is impacted) may not be of interest to us, the various behaviors they modelled may be.\nBrenner, B. (2013). The Short List. Leadership & Management in Engineering, 13(4), 280–281. http://doi.org/10.3200/ENVT.50.5.12-25 This was in the policy and building energy use folder, but I felt it was more appropriate here. This is a pop-sci article talking about how households tend to consume energy. A large focus is on the use of appliances and their impact on consumption. There is a little bit on thermostat usage as well. There are citations to back their figures up if we want to cite recommendations towards various energy conservation behaviors.\nEhrhardt-Martinez, K. (2015). Behaviour wedge profiles for cities. Eceee Summer Study Proceedings, (2008), 691–702. This article discusses potential energy savings for cities (20-30%) based on residential behavior changes. Of particular interest, it outlines a methodology for assessing the importance of various energy consumption behaviors based on the savings potential of various behaviors (including heat use) and current behavior practice amongst cities’ citizens.\nEhrhardt-Martinez, K. E. (2014). Residential energy savings opportunities in the city of Baltimore, Marlyand. Municipal Behavioral Wedge Report, Garrison Institute & Human Dimensions Research Associates Her public report as an example of a wedge report. It has estimates about Baltimore residents’ energy use behaviors, and recommendations for what individuals should do in order to become more efficient. Cites EPA recommendations for thermostat usage (58 at night and away, 68 when people are home). Also has recommendations for conserving heat in the house.\nSadeghi, S.

Building and Environment, 97, 177–195. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.12.008 This is a study Panagiota was on which looked at how different controls related to lighting (electric shades vs. overhead lighting) and found that less energy was consumed when individuals had access to easy to control shading. May be of use in talking about alexa control vs. tablet control. Note that there is a 2017 article by Ilias, Panagiota, and then two other authors (Seyed Sadeghi and Nimish Awalgaonkar) that extends this study by modelling their findings and including external variables of how sunny or shady a given day is.\nTodd, A., Stuart, E., Goldman, C., & Schiller, S.

Proceedings of the 2012 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings. A 60+ page report by the State and Local Energy Efficiency Action Network on what methodologies and measurements are appropriate for studies on energy savings. Has chapters on concepts and issues in energy saving contexts, and then two chapters on internal and external validity respectively. This may be a useful piece of literature when trying to contextualize our findings and moving findings to in-the-field studies.\nCommunity goals research. This research is mostly focused around community goals balancing and description with a focus on prosumer (consumers who also generate energy through means like solar panels).\nRathnayaka, A. J. D., Potdar, V. M., Dillon, T., Hussain, O., & Kuruppu, S. (2014). Goal-oriented prosumer community groups for the smart grid. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 33(1), 41–48. http://doi.org/10.1109/MTS.2014.2301859 This article created a framework for balancing and coordinating energy consumption goals amongst consumers who are conservation-minded and generate their own energy (through means such as solar panels), which the article labels as prosumers. This study builds upon Rathnayaka, Potdar, Dillon, Hussain, and Kuruppu (2011) which set out to model Australian prosumers’ energy behaviors across two seasons. Rathnayaka, Potdar, and Ou (2012) builds on the 2011 article as well in the context of balancing energy consumption and input from prosumers using a smart grid.\nOntology research. These articles focus on describing the environment of relevant factors in residential energy consumer behavior. Studies not included in this bibliography largely focused on how to use ontological reasoning in smart technology on both the system consumption side and user side.\nHong, T., D’Oca, S., Taylor-Lange, S. C., Turner, W. J. N., Chen, Y., & Corgnati, S. P. (2015). An ontology to represent energy-related occupant behavior in buildings. Part II: Implementation of the DNAS framework using an XML schema. Building and Environment, 94(P1), 196–205. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.08.006 This article was a review of literature aiming to describe the factors influencing occupant driven energy consumption. It does not describe what occupants should do, but aims to provide a thorough explanation of relevant factors in what people actually do. They posit drivers, needs, systems, and action as relevant factors. Examples of drivers are the building, occupant (age, gender), environment (such as indoor air temperature or season), system (are windows open, ect.), and time as factors driving energy changes. Need represents comfort or necessities of the occupant. System represents the iterative nature of the residential environment. Action represents what the occupant can do as influenced by the other three factors (opening a window, turning down thermostat).\nMahdavi, A., & Taheri, M. (2016). An ontology for building monitoring. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 0(0), 1–10. http://doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2016.1243730 This article lays out suggestions for how best to collect and analyze energy consumption, with a focus on environmental factors of importance, such as inhabitants, indoor environment conditions, external environment conditions, control devices, equipment, and energy flows. We could use this as well as the Hong et al. (2015) articles as guidelines for what influential cues we may need to account for in individual’s decision making.\nResearch on feedback mechanisms. This research looks at how specific types of feedback impact consumer behavior. I thought this may be of interest to Dr. Raymond. There were some articles on forecasting that I cut out, as well as those on social messages from resident to resident.\nAnderson, K., Song, K., Lee, S. H., Krupka, E., Lee, H., & Park, M. (2017). Longitudinal analysis of normative energy use feedback on dormitory occupants. Applied Energy, 189, 623–639. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.086 Shows that normative feedback can produce long term change via two year long studies on normative feedback in dormitories. This may be very useful in any studies in the honors’ college. Found that normative feedback was not helpful in the short term, but had a treatment effect of 14% savings over the course of the year for those individuals with a high concern for social norms, and a 5% change in those with low concern towards social norms.\nAsensio, O. I., & Delmas, M. A. (2016). Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization The dynamics of behavior change : Evidence from energy conservation. Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 126, 196–212. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2016.03.012 This is the closest to what we’d like to do, an experimental design approach to various feedback mechanisms. Could be good as a template paper. It’s a study on 118 houses over 9 months, comparing financial, health, and environmental feedback. They found 8-10% energy savings over 100 days. They interpret their results to indicate support for better results from stressing environmental feedback, and health feedback in particular.\nAyres, I., Raseman, S., & Shih, A. (2013). Evidence from Two Large Field Experiments that Peer Comparison Feedback Can Reduce Residential Energy Usage. Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 29(5), 992–1022. http://doi.org/10.1093/jleo/ews020 A study on how peer comparisons provided with energy bills either monthly or quarterly impacted individuals’ energy consumption over the course of a year. They found 1-2% energy saved. They used a smiley-frowney spectrum to represent consumers’ orientation towards their peers.\nEhrhardt-Martinez, K., “Laitner, J. A., & Donnelly, K. A. (2011). Beyond the Meter. Energy, Sustainability and the Environment. Elsevier. http://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-385136-9.10010-5 Another article by Dr. Ehrhardt-Martinez, this one looks at common sources of energy consumption and breakdowns of those sources. Specifically, this one looks at the sorts of energy draws that aren’t usually seen by consumers, such as applicance energy use. This report is split into five chapters outlining ‘invisible’ energy usage (appliances as a salient example), smart meters and displays, historical data, the impact of consumer behaviors, and the scope of potential savings.\nIyer, M., Kempton, W., & Payne, C. (2006). Comparison groups on bills: Automated, personalized energy information. Energy and Buildings, 38(8), 988–996. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2005.11.009 Looks at comparison groups on energy consumption bills and the impact on behavior. They provide suggestions on how to avoid misleading consumers, and how to use various energy outputs on the macro-level (meters at street v. residential level) to compare groups of individuals. It is worth noting that either Panagiota or Seng highlighted a section of the background section that discussed how geographically proximate consumers tended to have similar energy attitudes.\nKarlin, B., Zinger, J. F., & Ford, R. (2015). The effects of feedback on energy conservation: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 141(6), 1205–1227. http://doi.org/10.1037/a0039650 A meta-analysis of 42 studies from 1972-2010 that looked at energy consumption feedback and proenvironmental behavior. They found that, while most studies were significant, they varied in their effect size. They found that frequency, medium, comparative messages, durations, and intervention combinations all moderated the impact of feedback as a significant impactor of energy savings. They stress that this shows support for feedback as an intervention.\nJain, R. K., Gulbinas, R., Taylor, J. E., & Culligan, P. J. (2013). Can social influence drive energy savings? Detecting the impact of social influence on the energy consumption behavior of networked users exposed to normative eco-feedback.

Their hypotheses about edges (ties) impacting one another was significant, indicating more support that social norms can impact our energy consumption behavior.\nGrossberg, F., Wolfson, M., Mazur-stommen, S., Farley, K., & Nadel, S. (2015). Gamified Energy Efficiency Programs, (February). An overview of studies on 22 different gamifications of energy consumption. These include rewarding participants for specific energy saving activities, competition between teams towards energy savings, real-time feedback, and the use of virtual worlds. They note that some games worked on a narrow band of participants, but worked well (upwards of 10% reduction in energy consumption) while more generalizable games garnered a more reliable but modest portion of savings (3-6% savings).\nKhosrowpour, A., Xie, Y., Taylor, J. E., & Hong, Y. (2016). One size does not fit all: Establishing the need for targeted eco-feedback. Applied Energy, 184, 523–530. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.036 A study on 35 variously low, medium, and high engagement consumers for 69 days. They found that different levels of engagement impacted the effectiveness of their feedback intervention. This builds support for engaging different types of consumers with different strategies to maximize savings. It may be of interest to us, at some point, to see if we can use our data to measure individuals’ engagement levels.\nNilsson, A., Jakobsson, C., Thuvander, L., Andersson, D., Andersson, K., & Meiling, P.

Applied Energy, 122, 17–23. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.060 A study investigating continuous feedback interventions. They had two test beds; two town homes with 40 residents, and 32 households. They followed up with nine participants for interviews. In particular, they implemented a device in half the houses that continually gave visual feedback information. They found no significant savings benefits, and proposed that that understanding displays and being interested/engaged in the displays (and seeing benefits of changing habits) were significant barriers to the intervention impact.\nVellei, M., Natarajan, S., Biri, B., Padget, J., & Walker, I.

Energy & Buildings, 123, 179–191. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.03.045 Looked at at optimizing consumer decisions via instant feedback to 15 volunteer subjects living in an apartment over 6 months. The study in particular investigated the role of thermal comfort in influencing individuals’ thermal energy usage, and establishing measures and ranges for what was considered acceptable. This could be a useful article for establishing measures and operationalizations of ‘comfort’.\nXu, X., Arpan, L. M., & Chen, C. (2015).

Journal of Environmental Psychology, 44, 95–108. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.09.004 Looked at the differences between financial and environmental feedback for 461 online participants. In particular, they surveyed political and environmental orientations and found that environmentally framed feedback was seen more positively for individuals with moderate environmental concern as opposed to those with low or high concern.\nGame theory and gamification. Looks at literature on game theory. I took out the papers describing game theory without any direct application to energy consumption, and most papers focused on game theory from the electricity supplier side.\nChen, T., Member, S., Pourbabak, H., Member, S., & Su, W. (2016). A Game Theoretic Approach to Analyze the Dynamic Interactions of Multiple Residential Prosumers Considering Power Flow Constraints. This is an example of a supply-side game theory paper, albeit with some relevance to consumer behavior. A comparison of simulations using 33 nodes over 20-some iterations. It looks at how to integrate prosumers (consumers generating energy) into an energy consumption system. I’m not sure if this will be useful to us (will the final development have individual ways to generate behavior?).\nDimitrokali, E., Mackrill, J., Jennings, P., Khanna, S., Harris, V., & Cain, R. (2015). Indoor and Built Exploring homeowners ’ perception and experiences in using a domestic smart home heating controller, 24(7), 1010–1032. http://doi.org/10.1177/1420326X15606186 An analysis of users of smart energy consumption technology. They surveyed demographics, habits, and post-adoption satisfaction and feedback. They found that 70% of their 71 respondents were satisfied with the technology. Don’t know why it was in this section, but it does a good job looking at perceptions of smart tech use in energy consumption.\nKashif, A., Ploix, S., Dugdale, J., Reignier, P., & Kashif, M. (2015). Virtual simulation with real occupants using serious games. Laboratory of Grenoble for Sciences of Design, Optimisation and Production ( G-SCOP ) University of Grenoble , Grenoble Informatics Laboratory ( LIG ) University of Agder , Norway, 2712–2719. A simulation of energy consumption based on interaction with what the researchers call a ‘serious game’, which is intended as a feedback tool to educate consumers. They cite Wood et al (2014), which lays out criteria for evaluating these types of games. If we go this route, that paper will be important.\nResearch on low-income residents. Research specifically on the energy consumption behaviors of low-income residents. I found one article of use to us, which looks at specific obstacles and worries low-income individuals have about energy conservation.\nLangevin, J., Gurian, P. L., & Wen, J. (2013). Reducing energy consumption in low income public housing : Interviewing residents about energy behaviors. Applied Energy, 102, 1358–1370. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.07.003 These researchers interviewed 50 low-income tenets and analyzed the interviews for themes of energy consumption behavior and knowledge. Explicitly discusses knowledge gaps for lower income tenets. Notes that comfort and finances are issues in adoption of energy conservation behaviors.\nProbabilistic Programing. Largely a combination of Taylor, Jain, and their colleagues talking about how to program smart technology for energy consumption. Only two appeared to be relevant to the studies we’d want to do, so I’ve included those below.\nChen, J., Jain, R. K., & Taylor, J. E. (2013). Block Configuration Modeling: A novel simulation model to emulate building occupant peer networks and their impact on building energy consumption. Applied Energy, 105, 358–368. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.12.036 These researchers create a random social network generator called the ‘block configuration model’ to help researchers model energy consumption behavior. The paper is largely their discussion of random generation of various network components and interactions.\nGulbinas, R., Jain, R. K., Taylor, J. E., & Golparvar-Far, M. (2012). web-based eco-feedback, 13070. The researchers describe a web service designed to provide real time feedback to individuals about their energy usage as well as other residents in their building. They note that their system was used in other research by Jain and colleagues in college dormitories and does reduce energy usage. This is somewhat similar to what we discussed with the honor’s college, where we might give individuals log-ins to a system to see their energy usage.\nResidential energy data mining. This section largely had to do with how to collect and measure hvac and energy consumption data. I focused on those which reported findings relevant to understanding residential energy consumption behaviors.\nCarlson, D. R., Scott Matthews, H., & Bergés, M. (2013). One size does not fit all: Averaged data on household electricity is inadequate for residential energy policy and decisions. Energy and Buildings, 64, 132–144. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.04.005 This article discusses how some users skew the average appliance energy consumption as measured by RECS (not necessarily the instrument itself, but the data collected using it for the RECS national census). They note that this is important in that researchers should not try to model individual residential energy usage based on aggregate census data.\nAbreu, J. M., Câmara Pereira, F., & Ferrão, P. (2012). Using pattern recognition to identify habitual behavior in residential electricity consumption. Energy and Buildings, 49, 479–487. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.02.044 Discusses findings regarding how individual habits and weather conditions account for a large amount of energy consumption data. They study also aims to be able to predict patterns based on data-collection. They found that they could create baselines for general energy consumption without occupants (appliances on stand-by as an example), cold weekends, cold work-days, and temperate days.\nAlbert, A., & Rajagopal, R. (2015). Thermal profiling of residential energy consumption using smart meter data, 30(2), 1–10. Fairly technical report of how to separate energy readings from smart meters to see when thermal changes are due to individual decision making to consume thermal energy (HVAC in particular). I’ll admit this one went over my head, but it may be useful in interpreting individual behavior out of energy consumption data we get from the developments.\nKwac, J., Flora, J., & Rajagopal, R. (2016). Lifestyle segmentation based on energy consumption data. IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3053(c), 1–1. http://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2611600 An extension of Albert & Rajagopal (2015) looking at how to predict and interpret individual behavior based on energy data. The idea behind it is to allow for more efficient energy supply based on predicted usage. Again, not sure how helpful this article is for forming theoretical arguments, but could be of use down the road in measurement.\nSocial Norms. Studies on social psychology and how norms might be useful in creating behaviorally-sustainable energy conservation.\nBradley, P., Leach, M., & Fudge, S. (2014). The Role of Social Norms in Incentivising Energy Reduction in Organisations. Centre for Environmental Strategy Working Paper 01/14. Retrieved from http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ces/files/pdf/0114_Bradley_et_al_SocialNorms.pdf A 50-page report with a good overview of various psychological mechanisms influencing individual consumption and how to measure normative interventions. This appears to be very useful in outlining various social mechanisms we’d want to investigate, including attitudes, group identity, and descriptive v. injunctive norms.\nAllcott, H. (2009). Social Norms and Energy Conservation. Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, (October), 1–35. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.03.003 A study on 80,000 Minnesotan households receiving mailed feedback from an energy company. Allcott estimates that 1.9 to 2% monthly energy efficiency was gained by the program. One future direction proposed is that, based on the data, consumer-types can be profiled for more targeted feedback.\nSystem Design & Virtual.

Waste may have serious environmental consequences and there is a strong correlation between solid waste generation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. These two observations alone indicate that this development is not sustainable. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the environmental impact of waste. While, waste recycling in OECD countries is reported to be approximately 22% on average, many developing countries have recycling rates in the range of 1–3%. A key aspect in succeeding with any recycling effort is how authorities and other actors relate to both informal and formal waste workers. This paper reports on the findings of a systematic literature study with the aim of exploring waste recycling behavior, with a special focus on motivational factors, both physical and psychological, behind recycling. Three levels of descending importance for recycling have been identified, where two are vital for success, and the third is desirable; 1) a well-designed infrastructure for recycling 2) specific recycling knowledge, and, 3) a general understanding of environmental aspects. Any attempt to implement or improve recycling systems and/or recycling behavior, needs to consider these aspects and the insights gained through this research may provide decision makers with practical assistance. The paper also contributes by providing academia with a framework for further studies on the behavioral aspects of recycling.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Johansson (2016) proposes a model that highlights the interplay between individuals’ willingness to recycle and the external conditions that facilitate or hinder recycling efforts. The model underscores the importance of both psychological factors and systemic infrastructure in shaping recycling behaviors. Committed recyclers exhibit both high motivation and access to simple recycling systems. Their actions are often driven by internal motivators such as environmental values, altruism, or guilt, as well as external pressures like social norms or incentives. This group actively incorporates recycling into their daily routines, making it an intentional and consistent practice. In contrast, uncommitted recyclers demonstrate low motivation but still engage in recycling due to the ease of the process. For this group, the presence of highly accessible and straightforward systems, such as curbside collection, ensures participation even in the absence of strong environmental beliefs. Their behavior is largely habitual and reliant on external simplicity rather than internal conviction. Involuntary non-recyclers are individuals who are motivated to recycle but face significant external barriers, such as limited access to facilities, inadequate infrastructure, or unclear instructions. These barriers hinder their ability to act on their environmental intentions, suggesting that targeted interventions to reduce these obstacles could activate their latent motivation to recycle. Finally, uncommitted non-recyclers neither possess a strong belief in the importance of recycling nor have access to simple systems that encourage participation. This group is the least likely to engage in recycling, as they lack both internal motivators and external facilitators. Efforts to influence this group are most effective when systems are designed to make recycling as effortless as possible. Johansson’s (2016) model highlights the critical role of simplicity in recycling behavior, often outweighing the influence of motivation. While motivation can drive proactive efforts to seek out recycling opportunities, simplicity ensures broad participation by reducing the cognitive and physical barriers to action. These insights are invaluable for designing effective recycling programs, particularly in diverse populations where motivational levels and systemic support may vary.\n\n/Abstract/ Purpose – A considerable amount of research suggests that the way information is processed may influence a purchasing decision; however, this seems to be an issue rarely investigated in green marketing studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to draw on the literature related to the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to provide a deeper insight into the factors affecting pro-environmental behavior intention. Design/methodology/approach – The framework highlights the moderator role of environmental motivation and environmental knowledge in the relationships among message framing and pro-environmental behavior intention. The study used an internet survey to help reduce the social desirability bias associated with a face-to-face survey. In total, 497 questionnaires were collected, of which 68 were invalid and 429 were valid. Findings – The results indicate that it might be beneficial for green marketing proprietors to provide product-related information stressing the potential negative consequences of not buying organic food products. This effect, however, is moderated by the degree of the customer’s environmental motivation and environmental knowledge. Originality/value – This stands in marked contrast to the traditional information which emphasizes the positive consequences to motivate customers to purchase organic food products.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Chang and Wu (2015) examined how environmental motivation and knowledge influence the effectiveness of message framing in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Their study highlights the nuanced roles of these variables, revealing that motivation and knowledge interact to shape individuals’ processing of environmental messages and their subsequent behavioral intentions. For individuals with high motivation and high environmental knowledge, message framing (positive or negative) had minimal impact on pro-environmental behavior intentions. This group relies on heuristic processing due to their confidence and familiarity with environmental issues. Their established knowledge allows them to engage with environmental behaviors consistently, regardless of framing. In contrast, those with high motivation but low environmental knowledge exhibited significant sensitivity to message framing. This group engaged in systematic processing, carefully evaluating the information presented. Negatively framed messages, which emphasize the adverse consequences of failing to act (e.g., environmental degradation), were particularly persuasive. The negativity bias, characterized by heightened attention to potential losses, drove stronger pro-environmental intentions in these individuals. For individuals with low motivation, environmental knowledge played a limited role in shaping behavior. Regardless of whether their knowledge was high or low, this group processed messages heuristically and exhibited minimal differences in response to positive or negative framing. Their lack of motivation hindered deeper engagement with the content. Overall, Chang and Wu (2015) suggest that message framing should be tailored to the target audience’s level of motivation and knowledge. Negative framing is particularly effective for motivating high-motivation, low-knowledge individuals, while for other groups, framing may have a lesser impact. These findings underscore the importance of understanding cognitive and emotional factors in designing effective environmental communication strategies.\n\n/Abstract/ The household spending of Pakistani consumers on sustainable food consumption has continued to remain low. Hence, the present study used the goal-framing theory to explore the consumer’s motivational factors that derive sustainable consumption of organic food. Drawing on survey data of 488 respondents, the findings show that gain and hedonic motivations significantly affect purchase intentions; however, normative has an indirect role. In addition, the knowledge and perceived price significantly moderate the motivational factors. The study provides invaluable insights for policymakers and practitioners in identifying the motivational factors, and the means of guiding the right behaviors for sustainable consumption.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Khan et al. (2022) investigated the role of gain motivations and environmental knowledge in shaping consumer intentions to adopt sustainable behaviors, particularly the consumption of organic food. Their findings, grounded in goal-framing theory, emphasize the interplay between personal incentives and cognitive awareness in driving sustainable consumption. Gain motivations, such as financial savings or personal benefits, were shown to have a direct positive impact on pro-environmental intentions. These motivations influence consumers by appealing to their self-interest, fostering sustainable behaviors when aligned with tangible benefits. Environmental knowledge emerged as a significant moderator in the relationship between gain motivations and behavioral intentions. Consumers with higher knowledge levels were more likely to perceive the value of organic food, amplifying the effectiveness of gain motivations. Knowledge also serves to bridge the gap for less environmentally conscious individuals, helping them recognize the benefits of sustainable practices. The study highlights the need for strategies that combine educational efforts with incentive structures. By increasing consumer awareness and aligning sustainability with personal benefits, policymakers and marketers can encourage broader adoption of environmentally friendly products. Additionally, addressing barriers such as price perceptions is crucial, as higher costs can undermine the influence of gain motivations and knowledge. This work underscores the importance of integrating motivational and cognitive factors into sustainability campaigns, suggesting that tailored approaches can maximize the effectiveness of interventions across diverse consumer segments.\n\n/Abstract/ This research explores the factors influencing consumers’ intentions and behaviors toward purchasing green products in two culturally and economically distinct countries, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Drawing on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study examines the roles of altruistic and egoistic motivations, alongside environmental knowledge, in shaping green consumer behavior. Altruistic motivation, driven by concern for societal well-being and environmental sustainability, is found to have a stronger impact on green purchase intention and behavior in both countries, particularly in Pakistan. Egoistic motivation, which focuses on personal benefits like health and cost savings, also contributes but with a lesser influence. The research employs a cross-sectional survey design, collecting data from 1000 respondents (500 from each country) using a stratified random sampling technique. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relationships between variables and test the moderating effects of environmental knowledge. The results reveal that environmental knowledge significantly moderates the effect of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green purchase intention, enhancing the likelihood of eco-friendly consumption. These findings underscore the importance of environmental education in promoting sustainable consumer behavior. The originality of this study lies in its comparative analysis of green consumerism in two distinct contexts and its exploration of motivational factors through the TPB framework. Practical implications suggest that policymakers and marketers can develop strategies that appeal to both altruistic and egoistic drivers while enhancing consumer knowledge of environmental issues. The study contributes to the literature by expanding TPB to include the moderating role of environmental knowledge in understanding green consumption behavior across diverse cultures.\n/Potentially useful summary/ The research by Alawadh et al. (2024) provides significant insights into the roles of motivation and environmental knowledge in promoting green consumer behavior, specifically examining two culturally distinct contexts: Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Using Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a framework, the study evaluates how altruistic and egoistic motivations interact with environmental knowledge to shape sustainable behaviors. The findings highlight that altruistic motivation—rooted in concern for collective well-being and societal ethics—plays a more dominant role in fostering green purchase intentions and behaviors than egoistic motivation in both countries. In particular, Pakistan demonstrates a stronger reliance on altruistic motives, reflecting cultural values that emphasize collective welfare. In contrast, egoistic motivation, tied to self-interest such as health benefits and cost savings, has a smaller but significant effect on green purchase intentions, particularly in Saudi Arabia. A critical contribution of the study is its exploration of environmental knowledge as a moderator. It reveals that higher levels of environmental awareness enhance the impact of both altruistic and egoistic motivations on green consumer behavior by improving individuals’ understanding of the benefits of eco-friendly products, reinforcing moral reasoning, and increasing perceived control over their actions. This moderation effect is more pronounced for altruistic motivation than egoistic motivation, emphasizing the importance of environmental education in driving sustainable practices. Moreover, the study notes contextual differences in motivational dynamics, with altruistic drivers aligning with societal ideals in Pakistan and egoistic factors, such as health benefits, resonating more in Saudi Arabia. These findings underline the importance of tailoring green marketing and policymaking to reflect regional cultural values and socio-economic conditions. Alawadh et al. (2024) advance the literature by extending the TPB framework to include the moderating role of environmental knowledge and by comparing green consumer motivations across diverse cultural landscapes. Their work suggests that a combination of motivation-focused and knowledge-enhancement strategies could effectively bridge the gap between green purchase intentions and actual behaviors. These insights have practical implications for designing culturally sensitive interventions aimed at fostering sustainable consumer habits.\n\n/Abstract/ The motivations and barriers of the actual green purchase behavior are as real as the product itself, which makes it a systematic process to examine the inconsistency between consumers’ motivations and their actual behavior (motivation-behavior gap). The study aimed to clarify the direct and indirect effects of motivations on the purchase behavior of green food. The proposed conceptual model was adopted from the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework and was extended by adding the serial mediation of consumer perceived knowledge and trust as major constructs. Data were collected from 1788 consumers in China. Results provided support for the model and showed that perceived knowledge about the food supply chain could be both barrier and a positive factor of consumers’ purchase behavior, which mainly depends on the trade-off between certification and planting knowledge. Differences in trust exist and consumers hold authorities and certification bodies more accountable than farmers and retailers. For the direct effects, food safety concern is positively associated with behavior, whereas environmental concern is not. Policymakers shall use the results to narrow the motivation-behavior gap, especially for emerging economies.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Dong et al. (2022) explore the dynamics between motivation, perceived knowledge, and trust to address the persistent motivation-behavior gap in green consumption within the context of China’s food market. Employing the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework, they incorporate perceived knowledge and trust as mediators to understand the relationship between motivations and green food purchasing behavior. The study highlights that food safety concerns, a form of egoistic motivation, significantly drive green food purchasing behavior due to its alignment with personal health priorities. Conversely, environmental concerns, representing altruistic motives, have weaker and sometimes negative impacts on behavior. This disconnect is attributed to skepticism about agricultural practices and external, uncontrollable factors that complicate decision-making. Perceived knowledge plays a complex role as both a barrier and enabler. While detailed knowledge about certifications positively affects trust and behavior, knowledge about planting practices can deter purchases by raising awareness of agricultural pollution issues. Importantly, perceived knowledge alone does not directly influence behavior but mediates its effects through trust in the food supply chain. Trust in institutional actors, such as certification bodies and governmental authorities, is shown to significantly enhance green purchasing behavior. On the other hand, trust in farmers and retailers has negligible effects, highlighting the importance of systemic trust over personal relationships in this context. Dong et al. (2022) propose a serial mediation model, wherein motivations influence green behavior indirectly through perceived knowledge and trust. The findings underscore the need for transparent communication and robust certification systems to build consumer confidence, particularly in contexts where food safety is a critical concern. This work contributes to the literature by expanding the MOA framework to include trust as a critical determinant of green behavior and demonstrating the nuanced roles of different types of knowledge. It offers actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to bridge the motivation-behavior gap by addressing both cognitive and affective factors in consumer decision-making.\n\n/Abstract/ Purpose: Although the organic market has expanded in recent years, it remains small. Some researchers argue that consumers’ lack of knowledge concerning organic food is an important factor slowing down growth. This paper aims to focus on the factors influencing objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production and the relationship between both types of knowledge and consumer attitudes and motivations towards organic food and its consumption. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review is presented, relating to the impact of knowledge on behaviour in general and, more specifically, on organic food consumption. Several hypotheses are formulated concerning the relationship between objective and subjective knowledge, attitudes and organic food consumption and these are tested on organic vegetable consumption in Flanders (Belgium). Multiple regression models, a probit model and an analysis of variance are applied to a sample of 529 completed questionnaires (response rate=44 per cent). The respondents were selected in January 2007 using a convenience sampling technique. Socio-demographic variables are used to check representativeness. Findings: In the sample, the level of objective knowledge regarding organic vegetables is high. Attitudes towards the consumption of organic vegetables are generally positive. The strongest motivations for consuming organic vegetables are that they are produced without synthetic pesticides, are better for the environment, healthier, of higher quality and taste better. The strongest perceived barriers are overly high prices and lack of availability. Objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production show a positive correlation. Higher levels of objective and subjective knowledge concerning organic food are positively related to a more positive attitude towards organic food, greater experience of it and a more frequent use of information. Membership of an “ecological organisation” (VELT) is also related to higher levels of knowledge. Some variables have a significant positive relationship with subjective knowledge, but not with objective knowledge. Attitude is significantly and positively influenced by subjective knowledge, VELT-membership, norm, motivations and female gender. Perceived barriers have a significant negative influence on attitude. The likelihood of consuming organic vegetables is significantly and positively influenced by VELT-membership, subjective knowledge, attitude, motivations and the presence of children in the household. Whilst objective knowledge, norm and female gender have a significantly positive influence on attitude towards organic vegetables, they have no significant influence on the likelihood of actually consuming organic vegetables. Originality/value: Whilst several researchers argue that knowledge may be a very important factor in increasing organic food consumption, few have studied the mechanisms behind it. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper describing the impact of knowledge on organic food consumption in such detail. By assessing the impact of knowledge, as well as other factors, on organic food consumption, greater insight is gained with regard to organic food consumption behaviour.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Aertsens et al. (2011) explore the interplay between subjective and objective knowledge and consumer motivations in the context of organic food consumption. Their study provides critical insights into how knowledge types interact with motivational constructs to shape attitudes and behaviors toward sustainable practices. Both subjective (self-assessed) and objective (factual) knowledge play significant roles in reinforcing key motivations for organic consumption, including health benefits, environmental preservation, and product quality. Motivations rooted in altruistic (e.g., environmental concerns) and egoistic (e.g., health and quality) factors are positively associated with higher levels of both knowledge types. However, subjective knowledge exerts a stronger influence, reflecting the critical role of confidence in perceived expertise. This suggests that individuals who perceive themselves as knowledgeable are better equipped to align their motivations with their attitudes and behaviors. Subjective and objective knowledge contribute differently to the motivation-behavior pathway. Subjective knowledge, which incorporates self-confidence, enhances the perceived feasibility and desirability of organic consumption, thereby directly bridging the gap between motivational intentions and behavior. In contrast, objective knowledge indirectly supports this pathway by informing and strengthening motivational attitudes. While objective knowledge provides factual clarity, it is subjective knowledge that translates this understanding into actionable behaviors by fostering confidence in decision-making. The findings further suggest that knowledge mediates the relationship between motivations and attitudes. Motivated consumers with higher subjective knowledge are more likely to hold positive attitudes toward organic food, which, in turn, significantly increase their likelihood of adopting sustainable consumption behaviors. This underscores the importance of knowledge as both a driver and an enabler in the motivation-attitude-behavior sequence. Aertsens et al. (2011) identify a potential feedback loop wherein higher motivation drives information-seeking behavior, increasing objective knowledge. This growth in objective understanding feeds back into subjective knowledge, creating a reinforcing cycle that sustains and amplifies motivational influences. This dynamic highlights the interplay between motivational and cognitive constructs as an ongoing process.\n\n/Abstract/ Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become the fastest-growing waste stream, and consumer WEEE recycling is detrimental to the success of circular economy principles. However, consumer awareness of and willingness to cooperate in WEEE recycling is a core pillar of success as end users determine the ultimate fate of waste. This study presents the results of a survey distributed via social media in Portugal (n = 509) to determine consumer knowledge of and compliance or noncompliance with circular economy goals for WEEE as well as actionable insights for policy decision-makers and managers. Results show that the overall knowledge of WEEE posing health and environmental hazards is very high and that higher storage rates at home exist in younger demographics, students, and higher-income brackets. Our research highlights that not only are proximity to a recycling center and awareness of the location influencing factors required for recycling but also that recycling activities are mostly based on intrinsic motivation to protect the environment, with financial incentives only attracting a relatively small share of the study participants. While most studies on WEEE focus on developing countries, this study offers a distinct perspective by covering a mature EU economy.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Weilage et al. (2024) investigate the interplay between consumer motivation and knowledge in the context of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling in Portugal, emphasizing its implications for advancing a circular economy. Their research is particularly significant given the increasing volume of e-waste and the critical role consumers play in its management. The study reveals a high level of awareness among Portuguese consumers regarding the health and environmental hazards associated with WEEE. However, despite this knowledge, actual compliance with recycling practices remains inconsistent. The authors note that younger demographics, particularly students and individuals from higher-income brackets, tend to store more e-waste at home rather than recycle it. This suggests that while knowledge exists, it does not necessarily translate into action. The findings indicate that intrinsic motivation—specifically, a desire to protect the environment—drives most recycling behaviors. Financial incentives appear to have a limited impact on encouraging recycling among participants. This intrinsic motivation highlights the importance of fostering a sense of responsibility towards environmental sustainability as a means to enhance recycling rates. Weilage et al. (2024) emphasize the role of facilitating conditions in promoting effective recycling behaviors. Awareness of recycling centers is identified as a critical factor influencing consumer action. The study suggests that many consumers may not utilize established recycling systems due to a lack of knowledge about their existence or accessibility. Therefore, improving public awareness through targeted campaigns could significantly enhance participation in WEEE recycling initiatives. The insights from Weilage et al. (2024) provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and organizations involved in waste management. By identifying gaps in consumer knowledge and motivation, stakeholders can develop strategies that not only enhance awareness but also align with the intrinsic values of consumers to encourage more sustainable behaviors. The study advocates for comprehensive public education campaigns that highlight both the importance of recycling and the specific actions consumers can take to participate effectively in WEEE management.\n\n/Abstract/ We aim to identify influences on UK citizens’ household food waste recycling as a basis for designing strategies to increase household food waste collection rates via local services. Using a UK dataset (n = 1801) and the COM-B (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) model as a theoretical framework, we conduct quantitative regression and supporting thematic analyses to investigate influences on citizens’ recycling of food waste. Results show that automatic motivation (e.g., emotions and habit) and psychological capability (e.g., knowledge) predict household food waste recycling. Physical opportunity (i.e., dealing with food waste in other ways such as home-composting or feeding pets/strays, time and financial costs) was the main barrier to recycling food waste identified in thematic analyses. Participants also reported automatic motivation-related barriers such as concerns over pests, odour, hygiene and local authorities’ food waste collection capabilities. Based on findings we recommend the development of clear, consistent communications aimed at creating positive social norms relating to recycling and increasing knowledge of what can and cannot be put in food waste bins. Improved functional design and free distribution of bins and compostable caddy liners developed according to user-centred needs for cleanliness, convenience and hygiene are also needed. These will not be sufficient without a nationally uniform, efficient and reliable system of household food waste collection.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Allison et al. (2022) explore the interplay of motivation and knowledge in the context of food waste recycling among UK citizens, employing a mixed-methods approach grounded in the COM-B (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) model. Their research highlights critical barriers and enablers influencing household food waste recycling behaviors, aiming to inform strategies for enhancing recycling rates. The study identifies automatic motivation—encompassing emotions and habitual behaviors—as a significant predictor of food waste recycling. Participants expressed concerns related to hygiene, pests, and odors, which acted as barriers to engaging in recycling practices. These automatic motivations reveal that emotional responses can significantly influence behavior, often overshadowing rational knowledge about the benefits of recycling. Psychological capability, particularly knowledge regarding what constitutes recyclable food waste, is also highlighted as a crucial factor. The authors found that increased knowledge correlates positively with recycling behaviors; however, many participants lacked clarity on acceptable materials for food waste bins. This gap in knowledge suggests that educational interventions could enhance recycling rates by providing clear guidelines on proper waste segregation. The research emphasizes physical opportunity as a primary barrier to effective food waste recycling. Participants reported alternative disposal methods such as home composting or feeding pets as more convenient than using designated food waste bins. Additionally, logistical challenges, including the design and availability of collection services, hindered participation in recycling programs. To address these challenges, the authors recommend several strategies: enhancing public communication to foster positive social norms around food waste recycling, increasing knowledge about what can be recycled, and improving the design and accessibility of recycling bins. They emphasize the necessity for a nationally uniform and efficient food waste collection system to facilitate widespread adoption of recycling behaviors.\n\n/Abstract/ This paper aimed to explore knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of women towards the municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Tehran, Iran, to provide a basis for experts and decision-makers to develop or improve practical waste management strategies. Women’s contribution could markedly promote accomplishment of MSW management strategies, which has been neglected in many developing countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two stages: first, a random sample of 384 respondent women was selected from the 22 urban districts of Tehran, then 64 of them were randomly selected and trained face-to-face. The second phase was aimed at determining the effectiveness of face-to-face training and its impact on women’s performance in waste management. In both stages, data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions in four categories. Chi square (χ2) and Pearson correlation tests were applied to identify the association among variables. Results indicated that 69.6% and 72.9% of the women had adequate knowledge and attitude, respectively, while only 46.0% performed moderate practice on MSW management. Overall, significant association between education level, occupation, and marital status of the women with KAP towards reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of MSW were yielded (p &lt; 0.05). Adequate knowledge and positive attitude did not necessarily lead to the proper practice in this study. However, face-to-face training positively affected women’s practice in solid waste recycling and source separation. Conducting training programs and motivation of women by municipalities and decision-makers to elevate women’s environmental performance could substantially promote MSW management strategies in developing nations.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Zand et al. (2020) investigate the complex interplay between motivation and knowledge in the context of sustainable consumer behaviors, specifically focusing on the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a quantitative survey methodology, the study examines how various motivational factors, alongside consumers’ knowledge levels, influence their intention to purchase energy-efficient products. The research identifies intrinsic motivation—such as personal values related to environmental stewardship—as a significant driver of intention to adopt energy-efficient technologies. Participants who reported stronger intrinsic motivations were more likely to express intentions to purchase such products. Additionally, extrinsic motivations, including financial incentives and social approval, were found to play a complementary role, particularly among consumers with lower intrinsic motivation. Zand et al. (2020) highlight that knowledge significantly enhances consumers’ capability to engage in sustainable behaviors. Specifically, a higher level of knowledge regarding the benefits and functionalities of energy-efficient technologies correlates positively with the intention to purchase these products. However, the study also reveals that mere awareness is insufficient; understanding how to implement these technologies effectively is crucial for motivating action. The authors emphasize the dynamic relationship between motivation and knowledge. They found that knowledge not only serves as a facilitator for informed decision-making but also interacts with motivational factors to shape consumer behavior. For instance, individuals with high intrinsic motivation who possess detailed knowledge about energy-efficient options are more likely to overcome barriers to adoption compared to those with similar levels of knowledge but lower motivation. Based on their findings, Zand et al. (2020) recommend targeted interventions that enhance both motivation and knowledge among consumers. They suggest that educational programs should not only inform consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency but also foster intrinsic motivations by connecting these technologies to broader environmental values. Furthermore, policies that provide financial incentives can effectively complement educational efforts by addressing extrinsic motivations.\n\n\nKnowledge and motivation - provided by Torsten (searched through ChatGPT)\n\n/Abstract/ Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).\n/Potentially useful summary/ Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002) explored the complex relationship between motivation, knowledge, and pro-environmental behavior, addressing the persistent “value-action gap.” Their findings challenge the assumption that increased environmental knowledge directly leads to environmentally responsible actions, highlighting a more intricate interplay of factors. The study found that environmental knowledge is necessary but insufficient for fostering pro-environmental behavior. While basic awareness of environmental issues can guide action, a deeper technical understanding does not significantly enhance environmentally responsible behavior. Instead, knowledge serves as a modifier, shaping attitudes and values rather than acting as a direct catalyst for behavior. Motivation plays a critical role in determining behavior but is influenced by a combination of internal and external factors. Primary motives, such as altruistic and social values, often drive overarching environmental lifestyles. However, these are frequently overridden by selective motives, such as comfort, cost savings, or convenience, which dictate specific actions. The authors emphasize that situational factors, such as economic constraints, institutional barriers, and social norms, often obstruct the translation of motivation and knowledge into action. Additionally, psychological barriers, such as denial, apathy, and emotional detachment, further hinder pro-environmental behavior, even among those with strong environmental values and awareness. Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002) argue that the most significant positive influence on pro-environmental behavior occurs when internal factors (e.g., values, attitudes) and external factors (e.g., supportive infrastructure, economic incentives) act synergistically. For instance, individuals are more likely to adopt sustainable practices when they align with their values and are facilitated by accessible systems.\n\n/Abstract/ The goal of the present paper is a replication as well as an extension of the Hines et al. [(1986/87). Analysis and synthesis of research on responsible environmental behaviour: A meta-analysis. Journal of Environmental Education, 18, 1-8] meta-analysis on psycho-social determinants of pro-environmental behaviour. Based on information from a total of 57 samples the present meta-analysis finds mean correlations between psycho-social variables and pro-environmental behaviour similar to those reported by Hines et al. In a second step, the matrix of pooled correlations is used for a structural equation modelling (SEM) test of theoretically postulated structural relations between eight determinants of pro-environmental behaviour (so-called Meta-analytic SEM (MASEM)). MASEM results confirm that pro-environmental behavioural intention mediate the impact of all other psycho-social variables on pro-environmental behaviour (27% explained variance). Results also confirm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52% explained variance). The MASEM also indicates that problem awareness is an important but indirect determinant of pro-environmental intention. Its impact seems to be mediated by moral and social norms, guilt and attribution processes.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Bamberg and Möser (2007) conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate psycho-social determinants of pro-environmental behavior and tested a theoretical model integrating motivation and knowledge. Their findings revealed that the formation and activation of pro-environmental intentions and behaviors depend on the interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social factors. Knowledge, particularly awareness of environmental problems, serves as an essential precondition for pro-environmental behavior but exerts its influence indirectly. It shapes moral norms and attitudes by fostering internal attributions of responsibility, feelings of guilt, and adherence to social norms. Motivation, operationalized through moral norms and behavioral intention, mediates the relationship between knowledge and actual behavior. The study confirmed that behavioral intention is the strongest direct predictor of pro-environmental actions, explaining 27% of the variance in behavior. Moral norms, influenced by cognitive factors (e.g., problem awareness) and emotional responses (e.g., guilt), significantly predict these intentions, highlighting the role of personal responsibility. Despite strong intentions, situational factors such as perceived behavioral control (PBC) and structural constraints often limit the translation of motivation into action. Knowledge enhances perceived control and attitudes, making individuals more likely to act when external conditions are supportive. Their structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis supported an integrative framework where knowledge indirectly impacts pro-environmental behavior by shaping motivational constructs like moral norms and intention. The study emphasized the importance of combining educational efforts with structural and contextual interventions to bridge the gap between intention and action.\n\n/Abstract/ The present paper argues for three reasons why knowledge’s influence on ecological behavior is underestimated systematically. First, it is not the mere amount of knowledge available that determines behavior. Different forms of knowledge must work together in a convergent manner if they are to foster ecological behavior. Second, knowledge’s effect remains undetected also, because some statistical procedures neither correct for measurement error attenuation nor uncover mediated influences accurately. Third, psychological factors such as knowledge apparently have a limited influence on ecological behavior when strong situational constraints are effective. When an ecological behavior measure makes—as a performance test—systematic use of situational influences though, knowledge can be revealed as affecting ecological behavior significantly.\n/Potentially useful summary/ The role of knowledge in influencing ecological behavior has been widely studied, with Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) offering a comprehensive framework that highlights the importance of integrating various types of knowledge. Their work identifies four forms of knowledge that contribute to ecological behavior: declarative, procedural, effectiveness, and social knowledge. Declarative knowledge, which pertains to understanding environmental systems (e.g., the impact of greenhouse gases on climate), is essential for reducing uncertainty but has limited direct influence on behavior. Procedural knowledge, involving action-oriented skills such as recycling or conserving energy, facilitates ecological actions but often shows moderate predictive power. Effectiveness knowledge, which enables individuals to assess the relative impact of different behaviors (e.g., choosing energy-efficient appliances over curtailing driving), is crucial for informed decision-making. Finally, social knowledge, encompassing awareness of social norms and others’ behaviors, shapes actions by fostering compliance and avoiding social disapproval. Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003) emphasize that these types of knowledge must converge to effectively promote ecological behavior. While individual forms of knowledge may influence actions to some extent, their integration is necessary to overcome barriers and enable consistent pro-environmental practices. Moreover, they highlight that the relationship between knowledge and behavior is mediated by factors such as attitudes, intentions, and social norms. Traditional statistical methods often fail to account for these mediating effects, leading to an underestimation of knowledge’s indirect influence. To address this, the authors advocate for structural equation modeling, which better captures the distal effects of knowledge on behavior. Additionally, the study underscores the role of situational constraints. While strong external barriers can diminish the influence of knowledge, reducing these barriers allows knowledge to become a significant predictor of ecological behavior. These findings suggest that interventions should combine efforts to reduce situational constraints with educational strategies that integrate declarative, procedural, and effectiveness knowledge.\n\n/Abstract/ We review the personal and social influences on pro-environmental concern and behaviour, with an emphasis on recent research. The number of these influences suggests that understanding pro-environmental concern and behaviour is far more complex than previously thought. The influences are grouped into 18 personal and social factors. The personal factors include childhood experience, knowledge and education, personality and self-construal, sense of control, values, political and world views, goals, felt responsibility, cognitive biases, place attachment, age, gender and chosen activities. The social factors include religion, urban–rural differences, norms, social class, proximity to problematic environmental sites and cultural and ethnic variations We also recognize that pro-environmental behaviour often is undertaken based on none of the above influences, but because individuals have non-environmental goals such as to save money or to improve their health. Finally, environmental outcomes that are a result of these influences undoubtedly are determined by combinations of the 18 categories. Therefore, a primary goal of researchers now should be to learn more about how these many influences moderate and mediate one another to determine pro-environmental behaviour.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Gifford and Nilsson (2014) provide a comprehensive review of the personal and social factors influencing pro-environmental concern and behavior, emphasizing the interplay between motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the complexity of environmental behavior and challenge simplistic models that fail to account for the multifaceted influences. Environmental knowledge is a critical yet insufficient driver of pro-environmental behavior. It provides the cognitive basis for awareness and informed decision-making, but knowledge alone does not guarantee action. Gifford and Nilsson (2014) underscore that while accurate knowledge about environmental problems and solutions is essential, its impact is often mediated by values, attitudes, and external circumstances. Motivation, particularly when rooted in values such as biospheric or altruistic concerns, mediates the effect of knowledge on behavior. Individuals who are motivated by a sense of moral obligation or responsibility are more likely to act on their knowledge, translating awareness into tangible pro-environmental actions. The review identifies several psychological and contextual barriers that impede the relationship between motivation, knowledge, and behavior. These include cognitive biases, such as denial or apathy, as well as situational constraints, such as inadequate infrastructure or competing priorities. Overcoming these barriers requires interventions that not only enhance knowledge but also address motivational and structural obstacles. Gifford and Nilsson (2014) argue that pro-environmental behavior emerges from the dynamic interplay of personal factors (e.g., values, locus of control, and self-efficacy) and social influences (e.g., norms and cultural context). Interventions that combine educational efforts with motivational and structural support are more effective in fostering sustainable behavior.\n\n/Abstract/ Variables that predict “green buying” (i.e., buying products that are environmentally beneficial) were investigated. Predictor variables included awareness about environmental impacts of products, specific environmental beliefs of consumers, several general environmental attitude scales, demographic variables, and several proenvironment behaviors other than buying behavior. A written questionnaire, mailed to randomly selected residents of 8 middle-class communities in the Los Angeles area, was answered by 201 respondents. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the hypotheses under study: Specific consumer beliefs predicted several green-buying variables as well as general environmental attitudes, whereas general environmental attitudes predicted only one aspect of green buying. Women were significantly higher than men on two aspects of green buying and on the environmental attitude scales. Home ownership was positively related to recycling behavior.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Mainieri et al. (1997) examined the factors influencing environmentally conscious purchasing, or “green buying,” and explored the interplay between motivation and knowledge in shaping these behaviors. Their findings reveal the nuanced roles of consumer beliefs, attitudes, and demographic factors in fostering pro-environmental actions. The study found that while awareness of environmental impacts provides a foundation for green buying, it is not a direct predictor of environmentally conscious purchasing. Many respondents reported confusion about environmental claims, which limited their ability to act on their knowledge. This highlights the need for clearer and more trustworthy information to bridge the gap between awareness and behavior. Consumer beliefs, reflecting specific pro-environmental motivations (e.g., avoiding harmful products or prioritizing environmental safety), were the strongest predictors of green buying behaviors. These beliefs significantly influenced the number and type of environmentally friendly products purchased and the degree to which environmental safety impacted purchasing decisions. General environmental attitudes, in contrast, had limited predictive power for specific green buying behaviors. Despite expressing pro-environmental attitudes, many respondents did not translate these motivations into consistent purchasing behaviors. This disconnect was attributed to structural barriers, such as the availability, affordability, and labeling of green products. These factors often outweighed knowledge and motivation, underscoring the importance of addressing external constraints to enable sustainable consumer choices. Women were found to be more likely than men to engage in green buying, recycling, and other pro-environmental behaviors. However, other demographic variables, such as age, income, and education, were not significantly related to green buying, reflecting a demographic shift toward broader environmental concern across diverse groups. Mainieri et al. (1997) conclude that enhancing consumer beliefs and addressing structural barriers are critical for promoting green consumerism. Their findings highlight the importance of aligning motivation and knowledge with supportive external conditions to foster pro-environmental purchasing behaviors.\n\n/Abstract/ Taking sustainable actions in daily life to reduce human impacts on the environment is becoming a matter of great urgency. It is therefore relevant to understand the factors behind people’s sustainable behavior. Several psychological frameworks emphasize the role of motivation in sustainable behavior. We conducted a review of the literature to examine the motivation–sustainability relationship, with the following objectives: (1) explore consumers’ perception of the value conveyed by green products or services; (2) understand the factors that modulate the relationship between motivation and sustainable behavior; and (3) provide avenues for future research in psychology and formulate recommendations for application. The review of the results from 40 publications indicates that the symbolic value associated with green products or services can influence consumers’ preferences, choices, and sustainable behaviors. However, the perceived value of green products or services is modulated by dispositional factors, those specific to the characteristics and history of an individual, and contextual factors, those specific to a product being evaluated or the context in which the evaluation takes place. The results are discussed in light of the motivational, emotional, and attentional processes involved in sustainable behavior.\n/Potentially useful summary/ Mastria et al. (2023) reviewed the psychological mechanisms underlying sustainable consumer behavior, emphasizing the interplay of motivation and knowledge. Their findings highlight the significance of green perceived value and its influence on consumer choices, preferences, and actions. The concept of green perceived value, defined as the net benefit of a product based on environmental desires and sustainability expectations, plays a central role in motivating sustainable behavior. However, consumers’ understanding of product claims (e.g., eco-labels) significantly moderates this relationship. Those with higher knowledge about sustainability are more likely to value and act upon green information, demonstrating stronger purchase intentions for environmentally friendly products. Intrinsic motivation, such as the symbolic value associated with green products, and emotional engagement are pivotal in fostering pro-environmental behaviors. Consumers motivated by the desire to “do the right thing” or by pride in their sustainable actions exhibit stronger commitments to eco-friendly choices. Furthermore, emotional appeals, particularly those framing environmental consequences negatively, were found to enhance motivation by evoking feelings of guilt or shame. Despite positive attitudes toward sustainability, many consumers face barriers such as insufficient knowledge, unclear product claims, and external constraints (e.g., price and availability). These obstacles contribute to the intention-behavior gap, where motivation and knowledge fail to translate into sustainable actions. Mastria et al. (2023) recommend integrating educational initiatives to improve sustainability knowledge with motivational strategies that leverage emotional and symbolic incentives. Tailored communication, such as message framing based on product type (positive for essentials, negative for non-essentials), and clearer eco-labeling could enhance the impact of green perceived value and encourage consistent sustainable behaviors.",

In order to check for computers, fraudulent responses, or inattentiveness, a dummy check was used towards the end of the survey, asking participants to answer a question but with a second sentence that had instructions that asked the participants not to select any answers. The sample collected had 183 males, 103 females, and 1 that chose not to answer. Age ranged from 21 to 71 (M=36.25 SD=10.85). 40 participants had completed high school or had a GED as their highest degree; 58 had some college; 119 had a college degree; 18 had some graduate school; 51 had a graduate degree; and one declined to answer. Admittedly, this differs from national demographics by an overrepresentation of graduate education.1 participant did not have an income; 5 chose not to answer; 23 reported making less than $20,000; 109 made $20,000 to 49,999; 92 made $50,000 to $79,999; 32 made $80,000 to $109,999; 14 made $110,000 to $139,999; 6 made $140,000 to $169,999; and 5 made more than $170,000."

Knowledge was measured using the energy literacy sale which consisted of eight multiple-choice items with one correct choice and three incorrect options for each item (Dewaters & Powers, 2011); two scales from Attari et al. (2010) assessing the amount of energy per hour used and then saved by various household appliances, consisting of 9 open-ended numeric questions for energy use and 6 open-ended numeric questions for energy savings. Attitude was measured using the new ecological paradigm scales from Dunlap (2000) which consisted of two scales consisting of seven and eight five-point likert scale items; as well as a three-item scale from Reimer (in press). Motivation was measured using 15 eight-point likert scale items from Attari et al. (2010);"
