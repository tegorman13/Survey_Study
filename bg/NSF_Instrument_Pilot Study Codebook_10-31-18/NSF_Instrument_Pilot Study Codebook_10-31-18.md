# Summary

This codebook details variable names for the instrument study launched on 10-31-18. The block names used in qualtrics are not used for the codebook; however, a description of them is useful for understanding why certain survey items are split up / ordered the way they are. Not every question within each block lines up perfectly with the block topic (for instance, some questions in the temperature and lightbulb block assess motivation as well). Instrument items were broken up in the Qualtrics into the following blocks: motivation, numeracy, energy unit knowledge, consumption knowledge, temperature and lightbulb practices, efficiency conversions, attitudes, an mturk bot check, typical temperature questions, and then politics.

| Question Description | Variable | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The questions below can be categorized as belonging to one of |  |  |
| 8 areas: motivation, knowledge, demographics, attitudes, |  |  |
| politics, practices, specific behaviors, and other. Each |  |  |
| associated variable is highlighted with a color indicating its |  |  |
| area. The key for these colors is as follows: |  |  |
| Motivation |  |  |
| Knowledge |  |  |
| Demographics |  |  |

| ATTARI ENERGY SURVEY (PART 1) |  |  |
| The Attari energy survey has four parts: the perceived |  |  |

| covered in part one. Perceived difficulty items have no correct |  |  |

# **ATTARI ENERGY SURVEY (PART 2)**

**This is the second half of the Attari survey, with relative energy usage and relative energy savings.** Note: participants were given a scale that goes 0 to 200; the numbers below often exceed 200.

# **Relative Energy Usage**

A 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses 100 units of energy in one hour. How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically uses in one hour? Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Your best estimates are fine. Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

# NEP

From Dunlap, 2000. Assesses newer and older ways of thinking about the environment.

The new paradigm questions are scored such that 5=environmentally conscious paradigm. The old paradigm is scored such that 1=environmentally conscious paradigm. The new paradigm items are indicated by bolded text.

Listed below are statements about the relationship between humans and the environment. For each one, please indicate to what degree you agree or disagree.

**We are approaching the limit of the number of people the earth can support?**

Humans have the right to modify the natural environment to suit their needs?

**When humans interfere with nature it often produces disastrous consequences?**

Human ingenuity will ensure that we do NOT make the earth unlivable?

**Humans are severely abusing the environment?**

The earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them?

**Plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist?**

The balance of nature is strong enough to cope with the impacts of modern industrial nations?

**Despite our special abilities humans are still subject to the laws of nature?**

The so-called "ecological crisis" facing humankind has been greatly exaggerated?

| How often do you encounter discomfort from your residence |  |  |

| options are not in the codebook verbatim as the questions are a |  |  |

| MC row for "is this action possible", "How often do you use |  |  |
