## Numbers study

WE used two studies to assess how reference class and task formatting influenced the performance of individuals in coming up with plans to use less energy. The first study’s design was 4 state temperature (2 warm vs. 2 cold states) X 3 task reference class (USD v. Percentage vs.kWh) between. the design of the second study was a 4 state temperature (2 warm vs. 2 cold states) X 2 task goal (25% vs. 15%) X 2 last year’s usage for the family and the state average (exact vs. rounded numbers) within X 3 task reference class (USD v. Percentage vs.kWh) between. In total, there are 96 conditions, representing each possible order (2 orders x 4 states x 2 possible significant digit values, and 3 reference classes).
