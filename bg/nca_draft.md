## Data

Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk service was used to collect participants (N=287) from October 31st through November 2nd, 2018. In order to check for computers, fraudulent responses, or inattentiveness, a dummy check was used towards the end of the survey, asking participants to answer a question but with a second sentence that had instructions that asked the participants not to select any answers. The sample collected had 183 males, 103 females, and 1 that chose not to answer. Age ranged from 21 to 71 (M=36.25 SD=10.85). 40 participants had completed high school or had a GED as their highest degree; 58 had some college; 119 had a college degree; 18 had some graduate school; 51 had a graduate degree; and one declined to answer. Admittedly, this differs from national demographics by an overrepresentation of graduate education.1 participant did not have an income; 5 chose not to answer; 23 reported making less than $20,000; 109 made $20,000 to 49,999; 92 made $50,000 to $79,999; 32 made $80,000 to $109,999; 14 made $110,000 to $139,999; 6 made $140,000 to $169,999; and 5 made more than $170,000.

## Materials

Eight scales were used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and motivation. Knowledge was measured using the energy literacy sale which consisted of eight multiple-choice items with one correct choice and three incorrect options for each item (Dewaters & Powers, 2011); two scales from Attari et al. (2010) assessing the amount of energy per hour used and then saved by various household appliances, consisting of 9 open-ended numeric questions for energy use and 6 open-ended numeric questions for energy savings. Attitude was measured using the new ecological paradigm scales from Dunlap (2000) which consisted of two scales consisting of seven and eight five-point likert scale items; as well as a three-item scale from Reimer (in press). Motivation was measured using 15 eight-point likert scale items from Attari et al. (2010);
