## Introduction

This notebook explores data from a multi-survey study investigating the relationships between sustainable behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes. The study involved participants completing five different surveys, each designed to measure different aspects of these constructs. This analysis focuses on understanding these relationships, with a particular emphasis on the connection between knowledge and motivation.

The five surveys are categorized as follows:

**Knowledge Measures:**

*   **Energy Literacy Survey (ELS01-ELS08):** Assesses participants' knowledge of energy concepts through multiple-choice questions.
*   **Attari Energy Survey - Part 1: Numeracy Questions (ATT16-ATT18):** Assesses numerical literacy through probability questions requiring numeric answers.
*   **Attari Energy Survey - Part 2: Relative Energy Usage (ATT19-ATT27):** Asks participants to estimate the relative energy usage of various devices compared to a 100-Watt bulb.
*   **Attari Energy Survey - Part 2: Relative Energy Savings (ATT28-ATT33):** Asks participants to estimate the relative energy savings of various actions compared to turning off a 100-Watt bulb.

**Motivation/Attitude Measures:**

*   **Attari Energy Survey - Part 1: Perceived Difficulty Items (ATT01-ATT15):** Measures how easy or hard participants would find it to adopt energy-saving behaviors, using a rating scale.
*   **Recycling Study Questions (RS01-RS06):** Assesses participants' attitudes towards the environment and politics.

## Data Loading and Preparation

This section loads the necessary R libraries and the survey response data from two RDS files (`draw.rds` and `dinst.rds`). It then combines subsets of the data corresponding to the different surveys into separate data frames for easier analysis.

```{r load-libraries}
# Load required R libraries for data analysis and visualization
pacman::p_load(dplyr,purrr,tidyr,here, haven,tibble,ggplot2,ggh4x,lme4,knitr,kableExtra,gt,pander,flextable,ggh4x,psych,corrplot,factoextra)
options(digits=2, scipen=999, dplyr.summarise.inform=FALSE)

library(gridExtra)
library(factoextra)
library(mgcv)
library(lavaan)
library(CCA)
library(qgraph)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(mclust)
library(tidyLPA)

select <- dplyr::select # to avoid masking conflicts

source(here("scripts", "survey_functions.R")) # Load custom survey scoring functions
```

The following code block loads the data from RDS files and combines data from different sources for each survey instrument (Attari Energy Survey Part 1, Attari Energy Survey Part 2, Energy Literacy Survey).

```{r load-data}
# Load data from RDS files
draw <- readRDS(here("data", "draw.rds"))
#dinst <- readRDS(here("data", "dinst.rds"))

# Combine data from different sources for each survey part
aes1 <- draw %>% select(id, ATT01:ATT18)
#aes2 <- dinst %>% select(id, ATT01:ATT18)
aes_combined <- bind_rows(aes1)

att_useSave <- draw %>% select(id, ATT19:ATT33)
#att_useSave2 <- dinst %>% select(id, ATT19:ATT33)
att2_combined <- bind_rows(att_useSave)

els1 <- draw %>% select(id, ELS01:ELS08)
#els2 <- dinst %>% select(id, ELS01:ELS08)
els <- bind_rows(els1)

rs1 <- draw %>% select(id, RS01:RS06)
#rs2 <- dinst %>% select(id, RS01:RS06)
rs <- bind_rows(rs1)
```

This code block processes the raw survey responses using custom scoring functions to generate meaningful scores for each participant in each survey.  These scores are then merged into a single data frame (`combined_scores`). Finally, columns are renamed for clarity.

```{r score-surveys}
# Analyze and score each survey using custom functions
attari1 <- analyze_attari_survey_part1(aes_combined)
attari2_scores <- analyze_attari_survey(att2_combined)
els_scores <- analyze_els_survey(els)
rs_scores <- analyze_recycling_survey(rs)

# Combine all scores into one dataframe
combined_scores <- attari1 %>%
  left_join(attari2_scores, by = "id") %>%
  left_join(els_scores, by = "id") %>%
  left_join(rs_scores, by = "id")

# Rename columns for clarity
names(combined_scores) <- c(
  "id", "perceived_difficulty", "numeracy",
  "energy_use", "energy_save",
  "els_accuracy", "els_score",
  "env_attitude", "env_attitude_z",
  "pol_conservatism", "pol_conservatism_z"
)

head(combined_scores, 5) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F)
```

The table above shows the first five rows of the `combined_scores` data frame, providing a snapshot of the calculated scores for each participant across the different measures. The scores include perceived difficulty, numeracy, energy use knowledge, energy savings knowledge, Energy Literacy Survey (ELS) accuracy, ELS score, environmental attitude, and political conservatism (both raw and z-scored).

## Descriptive Statistics: Distributions of Key Variables

To understand the distribution of the key variables, histograms are generated for each score. This provides a visual check of the range and central tendency of each measure.

```{r descriptive-histograms}
# Select key variables for plotting distributions
key_vars <- combined_scores %>%
  select(perceived_difficulty, numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score, env_attitude, pol_conservatism)

# Melt the data for plotting with ggplot2
melted_vars <- key_vars %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "value")

# Plot histograms for each key variable
ggplot(melted_vars, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Key Variables", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")
```

The histograms display the distributions of each score.  We can observe the shape and spread of each variable, which helps in understanding the nature of the data before proceeding to correlation and regression analyses. For instance, we can see the distributions for energy literacy scores, environmental attitudes, and perceived difficulty.

## Correlation Analysis

This section examines the correlations between the different survey instruments. A correlation matrix is computed and visualized to explore the relationships between knowledge, motivation, and attitude measures.

```{r correlation-matrix}
# Select relevant variables for correlation analysis
cor_vars <- combined_scores %>%
  select(numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score,
         perceived_difficulty, env_attitude, pol_conservatism)

# Compute the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(cor_vars, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Visualize the correlation matrix using corrplot
corrplot::corrplot(cor_matrix,
         method = "color",
         addCoef.col = "black",
         type = "upper",
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         diag = FALSE)
```

The correlation plot visually represents the relationships between the different measures. Blue colors indicate positive correlations, while red colors indicate negative correlations. The intensity of the color and the size of the coefficient reflect the strength of the correlation.

**Observations from the Correlation Plot:**

*   **Positive correlations among knowledge measures:**  Numeracy, energy use knowledge, energy savings knowledge, and energy literacy (ELS) are all positively correlated, suggesting that individuals who score high on one knowledge measure tend to score high on others.
*   **Negative correlations between perceived difficulty and knowledge measures:** Perceived difficulty is negatively correlated with numeracy, energy use knowledge, energy savings knowledge, and ELS. This indicates that individuals with higher energy knowledge tend to perceive energy-saving behaviors as less difficult.
*   **Positive correlation between environmental attitude and ELS:** Environmental attitude shows a positive correlation with energy literacy, suggesting that individuals with more pro-environmental attitudes tend to have higher energy literacy.
*   **Negative correlation between political conservatism and environmental attitude:** Political conservatism is negatively correlated with environmental attitude, as expected.

## Regression Analysis: Predicting Energy Literacy

To further explore the relationships, linear regression models were used to predict energy literacy (ELS score) from motivation and other knowledge scores, controlling for potential confounding variables.

### Simple Linear Regression Models

First, simple linear regression models are examined to assess the individual relationships between perceived difficulty, environmental attitude, numeracy, and energy use knowledge with energy literacy.

#### Perceived Difficulty vs. ELS Score

```{r regression-pd-els}
# Scatter plot of perceived difficulty vs. ELS score with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = perceived_difficulty, y = els_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Perceived Difficulty vs. Energy Literacy Score",
       x = "Perceived Difficulty (Attari Part 1)",
       y = "Energy Literacy Score (ELS)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: ELS score predicted by perceived difficulty
model_els_pd <- lm(els_score ~ perceived_difficulty, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_els_pd)
```

The scatter plot shows a negative trend, and the linear regression confirms a statistically significant negative relationship between perceived difficulty and energy literacy score.  As perceived difficulty increases, energy literacy tends to decrease.

#### Environmental Attitude vs. ELS Score

```{r regression-ea-els}
# Scatter plot of environmental attitude vs. ELS score with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = env_attitude, y = els_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Environmental Attitude vs. Energy Literacy Score",
       x = "Environmental Attitude (Recycling Survey)",
       y = "Energy Literacy Score (ELS)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: ELS score predicted by environmental attitude
model_els_ea <- lm(els_score ~ env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_els_ea)
```

The scatter plot and regression output indicate a statistically significant positive relationship between environmental attitude and energy literacy. Higher environmental attitude is associated with higher energy literacy scores.

#### Perceived Difficulty vs. Numeracy

```{r regression-pd-num}
# Scatter plot of perceived difficulty vs. Numeracy with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = perceived_difficulty, y = numeracy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Perceived Difficulty vs. Numeracy",
       x = "Perceived Difficulty (Attari Part 1)",
       y = "Numeracy (Attari Part 1)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: Numeracy predicted by perceived difficulty
model_num_pd <- lm(numeracy ~ perceived_difficulty, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_num_pd)
```

There is a statistically significant negative relationship between perceived difficulty and numeracy, indicating that higher perceived difficulty is associated with lower numeracy scores.

#### Environmental Attitude vs. Numeracy

```{r regression-ea-num}
# Scatter plot of environmental attitude vs. Numeracy with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = env_attitude, y = numeracy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Environmental Attitude vs. Numeracy",
       x = "Environmental Attitude (Recycling Survey)",
       y = "Numeracy (Attari Part 1)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: Numeracy predicted by environmental attitude
model_num_ea <- lm(numeracy ~ env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_num_ea)
```

A statistically significant positive relationship is observed between environmental attitude and numeracy. Higher environmental attitude is associated with higher numeracy scores.

#### Perceived Difficulty vs. Energy Use Knowledge

```{r regression-pd-eu}
# Scatter plot of perceived difficulty vs. Energy Use Knowledge with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = perceived_difficulty, y = energy_use)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Perceived Difficulty vs. Energy Use Knowledge",
       x = "Perceived Difficulty (Attari Part 1)",
       y = "Energy Use Knowledge (Attari Part 2)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: Energy use knowledge predicted by perceived difficulty
model_eu_pd <- lm(energy_use ~ perceived_difficulty, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_eu_pd)
```

A statistically significant negative relationship exists between perceived difficulty and energy use knowledge. Higher perceived difficulty is associated with lower energy use knowledge.

#### Environmental Attitude vs. Energy Use Knowledge

```{r regression-ea-eu}
# Scatter plot of environmental attitude vs. Energy Use Knowledge with regression line
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = env_attitude, y = energy_use)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") + # Add linear regression line
  labs(title = "Environmental Attitude vs. Energy Use Knowledge",
       x = "Environmental Attitude (Recycling Survey)",
       y = "Energy Use Knowledge (Attari Part 2)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Linear regression model: Energy use knowledge predicted by environmental attitude
model_ea_eu <- lm(energy_use ~ env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_ea_eu)
```

A statistically significant positive relationship is found between environmental attitude and energy use knowledge. Higher environmental attitude is associated with higher energy use knowledge.

### Multiple Linear Regression Models

To understand the combined effects and control for confounding, multiple linear regression models are used.

#### ELS Score Predicted by Both Perceived Difficulty and Environmental Attitude

```{r multiple-regression-els-pd-ea}
# Multiple linear regression model: ELS score predicted by perceived difficulty and environmental attitude
model_els_pd_ea <- lm(els_score ~ perceived_difficulty + env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_els_pd_ea)
```

This model examines the unique contributions of both perceived difficulty and environmental attitude in predicting energy literacy. Both perceived difficulty (negative) and environmental attitude (positive) remain significant predictors even when considered together.

#### Numeracy Predicted by Both Perceived Difficulty and Environmental Attitude

```{r multiple-regression-num-pd-ea}
# Multiple linear regression model: Numeracy predicted by perceived difficulty and environmental attitude
model_num_pd_ea <- lm(numeracy ~ perceived_difficulty + env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_num_pd_ea)
```

Similarly, this model explores the combined influence on numeracy. Both perceived difficulty (negative) and environmental attitude (positive) significantly predict numeracy when considered together.

#### Energy Use Knowledge Predicted by Both Perceived Difficulty and Environmental Attitude

```{r multiple-regression-eu-pd-ea}
# Multiple linear regression model: Energy use knowledge predicted by perceived difficulty and environmental attitude
model_eu_pd_ea <- lm(energy_use ~ perceived_difficulty + env_attitude, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_eu_pd_ea)
```

This multiple regression model indicates that both perceived difficulty (negative) and environmental attitude (positive) are significant predictors of energy use knowledge, even when controlling for each other.

### Enhanced Regression Model: Predicting ELS from Motivation and Knowledge

This model predicts ELS score from motivation (perceived difficulty, environmental attitude, and political conservatism) and other knowledge scores (numeracy, energy use, energy save), providing a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing energy literacy.

```{r enhanced-regression-els}
# Enhanced regression model: ELS score predicted by motivation and other knowledge scores
model_els_enhanced <- lm(els_score ~ perceived_difficulty + env_attitude_z + pol_conservatism_z +
                           numeracy + energy_use + energy_save, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_els_enhanced)
```

**Regression Results:**

*   **Environmental attitude (env_attitude_z)** is a significant positive predictor of ELS, indicating that individuals with more pro-environmental attitudes tend to have higher energy literacy, even when controlling for other factors.
*   **Numeracy, energy use knowledge (energy_use), and energy savings knowledge (energy_save)** are also significant positive predictors of ELS. This suggests that individuals with higher numeracy skills and better knowledge about energy use and savings tend to have higher energy literacy.
*   **Perceived difficulty and political conservatism** are not significant predictors in this model when other variables are controlled for.

### Interaction Effects in Regression: Environmental Attitude and Perceived Difficulty on ELS

To examine potential interaction effects, a model is tested with an interaction term between environmental attitude and perceived difficulty in predicting ELS.

```{r interaction-regression-els}
# Interaction model: Interaction between environmental attitude and perceived difficulty on ELS
model_interaction <- lm(els_score ~ perceived_difficulty * env_attitude_z, data = combined_scores)
summary(model_interaction)

# Visualize the interaction effect
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = perceived_difficulty, y = els_score, color = env_attitude_z)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Interaction of Perceived Difficulty and Environmental Attitude on ELS",
       x = "Perceived Difficulty",
       y = "Energy Literacy Score",
       color = "Environmental Attitude (Z-scored)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interaction Results:**

The regression results and visualization do not show a significant interaction effect between perceived difficulty and environmental attitude on ELS. The relationship between perceived difficulty and ELS does not appear to vary substantially across different levels of environmental attitude.

## Cluster Analysis: Identifying Knowledge and Motivation Profiles

Cluster analysis is used to identify subgroups of participants with similar patterns of knowledge and motivation.

### K-means Clustering on Key Variables

First, k-means clustering is performed on the key variables to identify distinct profiles. The elbow method is used to help determine the optimal number of clusters.

```{r cluster-elbow-method}
# Prepare data for clustering: select relevant variables and scale
cluster_data <- combined_scores %>%
  select(perceived_difficulty, numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score, env_attitude_z, pol_conservatism_z) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  scale()

# Determine optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
fviz_nbclust(cluster_data, kmeans, method = "wss") +
  labs(title = "Elbow Method for Optimal k", x = "Number of Clusters k")
```

The elbow plot suggests that 3 or 4 clusters might be a reasonable choice. For demonstration, k-means clustering is performed with 3 clusters.

```{r kmeans-clustering-3-clusters}
# Perform k-means clustering with 3 clusters
set.seed(123)
km_result <- kmeans(cluster_data, centers = 3, nstart = 25)

# Visualize the clusters using fviz_cluster
fviz_cluster(km_result,
             data = cluster_data,
             geom = "point",
             ellipse.type = "convex") +
  labs(title = "K-means Clustering of Subjects")
```

The scatter plot visualizes the three clusters identified by k-means. Each point represents a participant, colored by cluster assignment. The ellipses represent the convex hulls of each cluster, showing some degree of separation and overlap between clusters.

### Cluster Profile Analysis

To understand the characteristics of each cluster, mean scores for each variable are calculated for each cluster.

```{r cluster-profile-analysis}
# Analyze cluster profiles by calculating mean scores for each cluster
cluster_profiles <- combined_scores %>%
  mutate(knowledge_cluster = factor(km_result$cluster)) %>%
  group_by(knowledge_cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_perceived_difficulty = mean(perceived_difficulty, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_numeracy = mean(numeracy, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_energy_use = mean(energy_use, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_energy_save = mean(energy_save, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_els_score = mean(els_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_env_attitude = mean(env_attitude, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_pol_conservatism = mean(pol_conservatism, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
print(cluster_profiles)
```

**Cluster Profile Analysis Results:**

The table shows the mean scores for each cluster across the different knowledge and motivation measures. This allows us to characterize each cluster based on their average scores:

*   **Cluster 1:** Tends to have lower scores on knowledge measures and higher perceived difficulty.
*   **Cluster 2:** Shows higher scores on knowledge measures and lower perceived difficulty.
*   **Cluster 3:**  Represents an intermediate group with moderate scores across measures.

### Knowledge Profile Clustering (Focus on Knowledge Measures Only)

To further refine the clustering, we can focus specifically on knowledge measures to identify knowledge-based profiles.

```{r knowledge-profile-clustering-elbow}
# Standardize knowledge variables for knowledge profile clustering
knowledge_vars <- combined_scores %>%
  select(numeracy_score = numeracy, relative_energy_use_score = energy_use,
         relative_energy_save_score = energy_save, els_score = els_score) %>%
  scale()

# Determine optimal number of knowledge clusters using the elbow method
set.seed(123)
wss_knowledge <- sapply(1:10, function(k) {
  kmeans(knowledge_vars, centers = k)$tot.withinss
})
plot(1:10, wss_knowledge, type = "b", main = "Elbow Plot for Knowledge Profiles",
     xlab = "Number of Clusters k", ylab = "Total Within Sum of Squares")
```

The elbow plot is used again to help determine the optimal number of knowledge-based clusters.

```{r knowledge-profile-clustering-kmeans}
# Perform k-means clustering on knowledge variables with 3 clusters
set.seed(123)
knowledge_km_result <- kmeans(knowledge_vars, centers = 3, nstart = 25)

# Add cluster membership to the data
combined_scores$knowledge_cluster <- factor(knowledge_km_result$cluster)

# Visualize knowledge clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca_result <- prcomp(knowledge_vars)
cluster_df <- data.frame(
  PC1 = pca_result$x[, 1],
  PC2 = pca_result$x[, 2],
  Cluster = combined_scores$knowledge_cluster
)

ggplot(cluster_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.95) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Knowledge Profiles Clustering",
       x = "First Principal Component",
       y = "Second Principal Component")
```

This visualization shows the knowledge-based clusters in a reduced dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Knowledge-Motivation Interaction Analysis in Clusters

To examine how motivation interacts with knowledge within these clusters, a regression model is used that includes an interaction term, and the results are summarized.

```{r interaction-regression-in-clusters}
# Interaction model: Knowledge-Motivation Interaction Analysis
interaction_model <- lm(els ~ env_attitude * perceived_difficulty_score +
                           numeracy_score, data = combined_scores)
summary(interaction_model)
```

**Interaction Analysis Results:**

The regression results do not show a significant interaction effect between environmental attitude and perceived difficulty in predicting ELS, even when considering knowledge clusters.

### Cluster Profile Analysis for Knowledge Clusters

To understand the profiles of these knowledge-based clusters, mean scores are calculated for each cluster across all variables.

```{r knowledge-cluster-profile-analysis}
# Analyze knowledge cluster profiles
cluster_profiles_knowledge <- combined_scores %>%
  group_by(knowledge_cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_numeracy = mean(numeracy_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_energy_use = mean(relative_energy_use_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_energy_save = mean(relative_energy_save_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_els_score = mean(els_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_env_attitude = mean(env_attitude, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_perceived_difficulty = mean(perceived_difficulty_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
print(cluster_profiles_knowledge)
```

**Knowledge Cluster Profile Analysis Results:**

The table displays the mean scores for each of the knowledge-based clusters on both knowledge and motivation measures. This allows for a detailed comparison of the profiles:

*   **Cluster 1:**  Low scores across all knowledge measures and also lower on motivation measures.
*   **Cluster 2:** Intermediate scores on knowledge measures and motivation.
*   **Cluster 3:** High scores on knowledge measures and also higher on motivation measures.

### Cluster Validation by Motivation-Knowledge Profiles

To validate the clusters, a scatter plot visualizes the clusters based on composite knowledge and motivation scores.

```{r cluster-validation-plot}
# Create composite knowledge and motivation scores
combined_scores <- combined_scores %>%
  mutate(
    knowledge_composite = rowMeans(
      cbind(numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score),
      na.rm = TRUE
    ),
    motivation_composite = rowMeans(
      cbind(env_attitude, -1 * perceived_difficulty),
      na.rm = TRUE
    )
  )

# Ensure cluster column exists (if not already created)
if(!"cluster" %in% colnames(combined_scores)){
  combined_scores$cluster <- factor(knowledge_km_result$cluster) # or km_result$cluster from earlier clustering
}

# Scatter plot of clusters based on composite scores
ggplot(combined_scores, aes(x = knowledge_composite, y = motivation_composite, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.95) +
  labs(title = "Knowledge-Motivation Profiles by Cluster",
       x = "Standardized Knowledge Composite",
       y = "Standardized Motivation Composite") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Cluster Validation Results:**

The scatter plot shows distinct knowledge-motivation profiles for each cluster, validating the cluster analysis.

*   **Cluster 1:** Low knowledge, high motivation composite.
*   **Cluster 2:** High knowledge, high motivation composite.
*   **Cluster 3:** Average knowledge and average motivation composite.

## Factor Analysis: Examining Underlying Structure

Factor analysis is employed to explore the underlying structure of the measured variables and identify potential latent factors.

### Factor Analysis on Key Measures

Factor analysis is first performed on the key knowledge and motivation measures.

```{r factor-analysis-key-measures}
# Select key measures for factor analysis
key_measures <- combined_scores %>%
  select(
    numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score,
    env_attitude, perceived_difficulty, pol_conservatism
  ) %>%
  na.omit()

# Perform factor analysis with 2 factors
fa_results_key_measures <- fa(key_measures, nfactors = 2, rotate = "varimax")
print(fa_results_key_measures, cut = 0.3, sort = TRUE)
```

**Factor Analysis Results (Key Measures):**

The factor analysis suggests a two-factor solution.

*   **Factor 1:** Loads strongly on environmental attitude and, to a lesser extent, political conservatism, suggesting a factor related to **environmental and political attitudes (Motivation Factor)**.
*   **Factor 2:** Loads strongly on numeracy, energy use knowledge, energy savings knowledge, and energy literacy (ELS), suggesting a factor related to **energy knowledge (Knowledge Factor)**. Perceived difficulty loads negatively on this factor, indicating that higher knowledge is associated with perceiving energy-saving behaviors as less difficult.

### Factor Analysis on Combined Variables (Question-Level Data)

To explore the factor structure at a more granular level, factor analysis is performed on all individual survey items.

```{r factor-analysis-all-items}
# Combine all items into a single dataframe
all_items <- full_join(aes_combined, att2_combined, by = "id") %>%
  full_join(els, by = "id") %>%
  full_join(rs, by = "id")

# Select only item columns for factor analysis
item_columns <- setdiff(names(all_items), "id")
item_data <- all_items[, item_columns]

# Perform factor analysis with 5 factors on all items
fa_items <- fa(item_data, nfactors = 5, rotate = "varimax") # Adjust nfactors as needed
print(fa_items, cut = 0.3, sort = TRUE)
```

**Factor Analysis Results (Combined Variables):**

The factor analysis on all individual survey items suggests a five-factor solution. The items load onto the factors in a way that is generally consistent with the hypothesized constructs (Knowledge and Motivation), although there are some cross-loadings.  This more detailed factor analysis provides a more nuanced view of the underlying dimensions captured by the survey instruments.

## Mediation Analysis: Testing a Path Model

Mediation analysis is used to test a path model examining the indirect effect of knowledge on energy literacy (ELS) through motivation.

```{r mediation-analysis}
# Mediation model: knowledge -> perceived_difficulty -> env_attitude
mediation_model <- '
  # direct effect
    env_attitude ~ c*els_score
  # mediator
    perceived_difficulty_score ~ a*els_score
    env_attitude ~ b*perceived_difficulty_score
  # indirect effect
    ab := a*b
  # total effect
    total := c + (a*b)
'

# Fit the mediation model using SEM
fit_mediation <- sem(mediation_model, data = combined_scores, missing = "fiml")
summary(fit_mediation, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

# Visualize the mediation model
tidySEM::graph_sem(fit_mediation)
```

**Mediation Analysis Results:**

The mediation analysis results suggest that perceived difficulty partially mediates the relationship between ELS and environmental attitude. The indirect effect is significant, indicating that higher ELS is associated with lower perceived difficulty, which in turn is associated with a more positive environmental attitude. However, the direct effect of motivation on ELS is not significant in this model.

## Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is used to explore the relationships between the set of knowledge variables and the set of motivation variables as sets, rather than individually.

```{r canonical-correlation-analysis}
# Prepare matrices for CCA: Knowledge and Motivation variable sets
knowledge_vars_cca <- combined_scores %>% select(numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score) %>% as.matrix()
motivation_vars_cca <- combined_scores %>% select(env_attitude, perceived_difficulty, pol_conservatism) %>% as.matrix()

# Perform Canonical Correlation Analysis
cca_result <- cancor(knowledge_vars_cca, motivation_vars_cca)

# Display CCA results: Canonical correlations and coefficients
print(cca_result$cor) # Canonical correlations
print(cca_result$xcoef) # Coefficients for motivation variables
print(cca_result$ycoef) # Coefficients for knowledge variables
```

**CCA Results:**

The CCA identifies canonical variates that maximally correlate the knowledge and motivation sets. The first canonical correlation suggests a moderate relationship between the two sets of variables. The coefficients provide information on how each original variable contributes to the canonical variates.

## Network Analysis: Visualizing Variable Relationships

Network analysis provides a visual representation of the correlations between all key variables, helping to understand the overall structure of relationships.

```{r network-analysis}
# Create correlation matrix for network analysis
cor_matrix_network <- cor(combined_scores %>%
  select(numeracy, energy_use, energy_save, els_score,
         env_attitude, perceived_difficulty, pol_conservatism),
  use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Visualize the correlation matrix as a network graph
qgraph(cor_matrix_network,
       graph = "cor", # Correlation graph
       layout = "spring", # Layout algorithm
       vsize = 8, # Vertex size
       esize = 3, # Edge size
       title = "Network of Correlations between Motivation and Knowledge Measures")
```

**Network Analysis Results:**

The network plot visually represents the correlations between all variables.  Positive correlations are shown in blue, and negative correlations in red. The thickness of the edges indicates the strength of the correlation.  The network plot provides a clear overview of the complex interrelationships between knowledge, motivation, and attitude measures.

## Conclusion

This exploratory analysis has examined the relationships between different survey instruments designed to measure sustainable behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes.  Key findings include:

*   Significant positive correlations among different knowledge measures and between environmental attitude and energy literacy.
*   Negative correlations between perceived difficulty and knowledge measures.
*   Regression analyses indicate that environmental attitude, numeracy, energy use knowledge, and energy savings knowledge are significant predictors of energy literacy.
*   Cluster analysis identified distinct profiles of participants based on their knowledge and motivation scores.
*   Factor analysis suggests a two-factor structure underlying the measures, representing motivation/attitude and knowledge.
*   Mediation analysis showed a partial indirect effect of energy literacy on environmental attitude through perceived difficulty.
*   Canonical Correlation Analysis and Network Analysis provided insights into the relationships between sets of variables and the overall correlation structure.

These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between knowledge and motivation in the context of sustainable behaviors and can inform future research and interventions in this area.
